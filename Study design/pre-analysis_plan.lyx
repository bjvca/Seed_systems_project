Demand and supply factors constraining the emergence and sustainability
 of an efficient seed system: A pre-analysis plan
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Agricultural technology remains under-adopted among smallholder farmers
 in Sub-Saharan Africa.
 We investigate how the quality of an agricultural technology – improved
 maize seed – affects its adoption.
 The research entails three hypotheses that will be tested in a series of
 randomized controlled trials among agro-input dealers and smallholder farmers
 in Uganda.
 In a first hypothesis, quality concerns that constrain uptake are caused
 by information inefficiencies at the level of the agro-input dealer, who
 is assumed to lack knowledge about proper storage and handling.
 An intensive training program is expected to increase improved maize seed
 quality and subsequent adoption by farmers.
 A second hypothesis conjectures that information asymmetry between seller
 and buyer with respect to the quality of seed – a classic lemons technology
 – leads to under-adoption.
 We implement a crowd-sourced information clearinghouse similar to yelp.com
 to test this hypothesis.
 This hypothesis targets the interaction between farmers and input dealers.
 A third hypothesis targets farmers directly, as sub-optimal adoption is
 assumed to be caused by learning failures: Farmers might attribute disappointin
g outcomes to poor input quality, while in reality many input dimensions
 like the time of planting, weeding and fertilizer application co-determine
 outcomes.
 An ICT-mediated information campaign that stresses the importance of paying
 attention to all input dimensions is implemented to test this hypothesis.

Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the most effective ways to increase agricultural productivity is
 through the adoption of improved agricultural technologies and practices.
 These include mechanization, but the Green Revolution has demonstrated
 that large gains can also be expected from improved inputs such as inorganic
 fertilizers and high yielding cultivars.
 Technology adoption remains lower than projected, particularly among the
 poor in sub-Saharan Africa 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "gollin2005technology"

\end_inset

.
 As a result, differences in yields between sub-Saharan Africa and areas
 that experienced a green revolution have nearly doubled since 1961 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 To reduce this yield gap, it is important to identify the drivers of, and
 constraints to, technology adoption.

 of agricultural technology have increasingly been studied using field experimen

 For instance, the Agricultural Technology Adoption Initiative (ATAI), a
 collaboration between MIT's Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL)
 and UC Berkeley's Center for Effective Global Action (CEGA) has funded
 a series of field experiments to illuminate what helps and hinders technology
 adoption among smallholder farmers.
 Key constraints identified include poor access to information

 We specifically explore (perceived) quality of improved maize seed as a
 constraint to its adoption among a sample of smallholder maize farmers
 in Uganda.
 Maize is an important crop there, both for home consumption and as a source
 of income.
 While improved maize seeds are adopted to some extent, various factors
 constrain the further development and sustainability of an efficient Ugandan
 seed system.
 Recent studies argue that smallholder adoption of improved inputs in Uganda,
 and of improved maize seed in particular, is limited by farmers’ beliefs
 that the inputs are of poor quality - counterfeited, adulterated, or otherwise
 non-performant 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Our study will test interventions aimed at identifying the relative importance
 of potential sources of these (perceived) quality issues at different levels
 for agricultural technology adoption.
 It will bring to light the cognitive, economic and behavioral aspects that
 underlie under-adoption of these technologies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Hypotheses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seed quality, or the perception thereof, may arise at different stages in
 the seed supply chain.
 Poor seed quality may occur as a result of input dealer practices.
 This may be unintentional, for example poor handling and storage practices,
 or intentional, for instance by mixing poor quality seed with good quality
 seed to cut costs.
 The problem may also be situated at the level of the smallholder farmer.
 For instance, a farmer may lack confidence in the input dealer or his/her
 products, and the nature of the input may make it impossible for the farmer
 to assess the quality.
 It may also be that the farmer wrongly attributes poor outcomes caused
 by factors other than seed quality to seed quality.
 We test interventions at different stages in the seed supply chain to assess
 the relative importance of each potential cause for low demand for improved
 seed.
 The first intervention targets the input dealer, the second targets the
 interaction between the input dealer and the farmer, while the last targets
 the farmer.
 Regardless of who is targeted by the intervention, we will assess changes
 in outcomes at both the input dealer level and at the level of the farmer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
H1: Seed is of poor quality due to poor handling and storage at the input
 dealer level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lack of information is pervasive in developing countries and often leads
 to sub-optimal outcomes for the rural poor.
 As a result, a simple piece of information can make a big difference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "duflo2011poor"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Also in the context of agricultural technology adoption among smallholders,
 informational inefficiencies have been documented, and governments around
 the world invest in public agricultural advisory services to increase productiv
ity in the sector 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "10.1093/wbro/lkh013"

\end_inset

.
 Various studies look at knowledge gaps at the farmer level and the consequences
 on outcomes like technology adoption and production.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1002/ajae.12089"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 show that maize farmers in Uganda appear to benefit from information on
 available technologies and recommended agronomic practices.
 While the need for policies and interventions that strengthen input marketing
 capacity and infrastructure has been acknowledged decades ago 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "TRIPP2001147"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, we find few examples of studies that look at knowledge gaps at the input
 dealer level.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first hypothesis asserts that poor handling and storage at the level
 of the input dealer may lead to poor seed quality, in turn reducing the
 profitability of seeds at the farmer level, resulting in low adoption.
 There is indeed some evidence of input quality reduction at this level.
 In a comprehensive study of the seed supply chain in Uganda, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "BARRIGA2020104928"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 document various issues related to handling and storage that may reduce
 the quality of the input.
 For example, farmers often need smaller quantities than what is in the
 standard bags, and input dealers thus often repackage in smaller bags in
 sub-optimal environments.
 Poor rotation of seed stock and storage in open bags in moist conditions
 or in direct sunlight also reduce seed quality.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test this hypothesis, an information treatment that consists of an intensive
 input dealer training to increase input dealer skills regarding seed handling
 and storage will be implemented.
 This is expected to improve seed quality, in turn reducing risk and increasing
 profitability at the level of the farmers.
 This will lead to more farmers adopting improved seed.
 It is important to note that this hypothesis implicitly assumes that the
 dealer is not aware of the fact that he or she sells poor quality seed.
 In other words, sales of poor quality seed is not intentional.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
H2: Seed is of poor quality due to intentional adulteration at the input
 dealer level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second hypothesis focuses on the information asymmetry between seed
 sellers and seed buyers.
 As argued in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bold2017lemon"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the market for seed in Uganda appears similar to the market for used cars
 as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeauthor
key "george1970market"
literal "false"

\end_inset

’s classic study 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyearpar
key "george1970market"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 In such a market, the quality of goods can degrade in cases where the quality
 is known by the seller, but not (yet) by the buyer.
 This problem can be solved by reducing information asymmetries between
 the two parties.
 While Uganda does regulate seed quality through seed certification processes
 and standards, this mechanism provides farmers with a relatively weak and
 unreliable indication of quality.
 Alternative mechanisms such as electronic verification systems have also
 been experimented with, but the cost of implementation has proven challenging,
 and they depend on the reliability of the underlying seed certification
 system.
 In our study, we will test an alternative, decentralized information clearingho
use that is based on crowd-sourced information and works through reputational
 mechanisms, much like yelp.com or tripadvisor.com.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the previous intervention aims to reduce unintentional seed quality
 deterioration that is caused by lack of knowledge, the clearinghouse may
 also reduce instances where quality is reduce intentionally to increase
 profit
\begin_inset Note Note
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A clearinghouse may affect both intentional and non-intentional quality
 reductions.
 If we combine H1 and H2, can we get an idea of the magnitude of intentional
 adulteration? Intuitively, if we know that knowledge intervention is responsibl
e for a increase in adoption of 15 percentage points, and we find that the
 information clearinghouse increases adoption by 20 percent, can we claim
 that adulteration reduces adoption by 5 percentage points? Can we get a
 better estimate if we exploit the factorial design (that is, some input
 dealers that are exposed to the clearinghouse will also get the training,
 so we could argue that they have to know that they are cheating)? 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In Uganda, there are some indications that adulteration happens at some
 point in the seed value chain.

 find that nearly one in three bottles of herbicide contains less than 75%
 of the labeled concentration of the active ingredient.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Information clearinghouse mechanisms have been studied to some extent, but
 mostly to address market price information asymmetry between smallholder
 farmers and middlemen.
 Assuming that middlemen are better informed about prevailing prices in
 the market than farmers, theory suggests that providing farmers with price
 information increases their bargaining power.
 However, evidence is mixed: while 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 finds that internet kiosks that provided wholesale price information significan

key "fafchamps2012impact"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 do not find a statistically significant effect of market information delivered
 to farmers' mobile phones by a commercial service called Reuters Market
 Light (RML) in a neighboring state.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A clearinghouse that relies on crowd-sourced ratings may be more effective
 to increase seed quality in the market.
 While prices can generally be observed reasonably easy, assessing an experience
 good such as seed is much harder.
 At the time of purchase, visual seed inspection is limited to seed purity
 and the presence of mold.
 Germination can only be assessed after planting.
 Some seed may also be more susceptible to pests and diseases, so the overall
 quality of seed can only be judged after harvest.
 Aggregation of the experience of many users may thus be a particular powerful
 way to reveal the quality of the product.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The study by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hasanain2019no"

\end_inset

, who set up a rating system for public veterinary services in Pakistan,
 is probably the closest to ours.
 They find that farmers who use the clearinghouse enjoy a 25 percent higher
 success rate of artificial insemination.
 Their research suggests that this is mostly due to increased veterinarian
 effort, as few farmers seem to be switching from veterinaries that receive
 poor ratings to veterinaries that receive good ratings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An information clearinghouse intervention may work through different impact
 pathways.
 First, farmers that do not buy improved seed may start buying when they
 see that the quality of the input dealer in their vicinity is better than
 expected (eg.
 above average).
 Furthermore, farmers may switch from low rated input dealers to higher
 rated input dealers.
 In addition, the clearinghouse could raise the input dealer's effort as
 he/she wants to improve his/her ratings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A crowd-sourced information clearinghouse can be an important institutional
 innovation to solve the problem of asymmetric information in the market
 for agricultural inputs.
 It may be preferable to alternative strategies such as regulating quality
 due to its likely lower cost, self-sustaining nature and scaleability,
 and helps to overcome problems such as insufficient public investment in
 regulatory systems, regulatory enforcement, and market surveillance.

H3: Seed is of good quality but farmers are unable to adequately learn about
 this quality.

\begin_layout Standard
In the context of new agricultural technology, production functions are
 not known.
 Farmers learn from own experience 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 test whether farmers’ learning heterogeneity is a barrier to adoption.
 They find that even though Bayesian learning is well suited to learn about
 hybrid rice, it is also more cognitively demanding, such that only 25 percent
 of farmers can be characterized as pure Bayesian learners while 40 percent
 rely on first impressions.
 Present-biased learning and relying on first impressions is likely to hinder
 technology adoption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Erroneous perceptions and false beliefs at the farmer level may complicate
 learning and affect technology uptake.
 For instance, high yielding varieties may be less resistant to particular
 pests and diseases or to droughts than local maize varieties that farmers
 in a particular area selected themselves over the course of centuries
\begin_inset Note Note
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Is this documented somewhere? Do we have references? During the maize study,
 Fiona, one of my RAs at the time, planted the hybrid the we promoted in
 her garden.
 She said she got much bigger maize cobs than her neighbour who used landraces,
 but that here maize suffered from fall army worm invasion while the neighbour
 had less issues.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Therefore, additional inputs such as pesticides, insecticides and irrigation
 may be needed to bring the seed to its full potential.
 Worse, farmers they may think that improved seed is a guarantee for higher
 yield and reduce management and use of other inputs.
 This may lead to disappointing yields, and farmers may erroneously attribute
 these low returns to poor input quality, which may lead to dis-adoption.
 The problem may thus be rooted in negative experiences which conflate low
 product quality with incorrect management practices and can be characterized
 as a learning failure.
 Consistent with this, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "michelson2018misperceived"

\end_inset

 find that fertilizers in Tanzania meet the requisite quality standards
 even though Tanzanian farmers persistently believe that the fertilizer
 they purchase from the market is adulterated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the present context, we hypothesize that there exists a particular learning
 constraint of interest.
 Because farmers must make decisions on a variety of input dimensions that
 interact in the production function - the time of planting, the amount
 and timing of water, the choice of technology, additional inputs such as
 fertilizer or pesticides and insecticides - they cannot easily learn about
 the quality of seed from their own or others’ experience.
 A key remedy to this learning problem is information, but the availability
 of such information alone does not automatically guarantee learning.
 Limited attention to particular input dimension may necessitate interventions
 that highlight previously unattended-to relationships in the data

\begin_layout Standard
To test the three hypotheses, we will implement three interventions that
 are combined in a field experiment where various treatment and control
 groups are randomly assigned to either a treatment or control condition.
 The randomized control trial (RCT) will take the form of a 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{3}$
\end_inset

 factorial design, with each intervention corresponding to one hypothesis.
 To test the first hypothesis, a random sub-sample of input dealers will
 receive training on proper seed handling and storage.
 To test the second hypothesis, a rating system will be set up among a random
 sub-sample catchment areas of input dealers, and farmer and input dealers
 will receive feedback on the ratings before the start of the planting season.
 To test the third hypothesis, a video that points out the importance of
 combining improved seed with other inputs and careful crop management will
 be shown to a random subset of villages.
 The treatments are further elaborated in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 Impact will be judged by looking at outcomes both at the input dealer level
 (eg.
 investments in seed storage infrastructure, quantity of seed sold,...) as
 well as at the farmer level (eg.
 likelihood that farmer adopted improved seed, maize yields,...).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Factorial designs allow recycling of treated units in the orthogonal factor
 to be used as controls.
 As such, to estimate main effects, less observations are needed than would
 be the case in parallel designs.
 The factorial design we will use deviates from commonly used factorial
 designs in that the experimental unit will differ depending on the factor.
 For the first two factors, corresponding to the input-dealer training and
 the information clearinghouse, randomization will happen at the level of
 the catchment area.
 For the third factor that address learning failures of farmers, randomization
 will happen at the level of the village
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The main motivation to randomize at the village level is to eliminate potential
 spillover effects for the third treatment.
 However, as we will discuss later, we make sure there is correspondence
 between villages and input dealers, which would allow us to also look at
 the impact of the farmer training treatment on outcomes at the input dealer
 level.
 However, at that level, spillovers may affect results.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The decision to randomize the first two interventions at the level of the
 catchment area instead of at the level of the input dealer has two main
 reasons.
 Often, input dealers are clustered in markets or trading centers with overlappi
ng catchment areas.
 Randomization at the level of the input dealer prompted ethical concerns.
 For instance, it may be that one dealer gets assigned to the treatment
 group for the information clearinghouse and receive a good rating, while
 his/her neighbor gets assigned to the control group of that particular
 treatment (and does not get rated).
 Farmers in the vicinity of the two input dealers farmers may be more inclined
 to switch to the dealer with that received the rating, even though the
 services of the input dealer in the control group may be the same.
 While, in this case, the rating would lead to a competitive advantage for
 the dealer that got the rating, the reverse may be true if the dealer gets
 a poor rating.
 Delineating a catchment area based on overlapping areas that are served
 by the input dealers and randomizing at this level reduces this concern.
 While this is less of a concern for the first treatment, we were still
 worried that providing an intense training treatment to one input dealer
 but not to his or her immediate neighbor may be difficult in practice.
 So also for this treatment, catchment areas will be targeted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second reason why we decided to randomize at the catchment area level
 is because we also want to measure the effect of the first two treatments
 at the level of the farmer.
 For example, if we would randomize the input dealer training at dealer
 level, one dealer might be trained but his or her neighbor not.
 If we want to know if the dealer training leads to increased adoption of
 improved seed among farmers in the vicinity of an input dealer, we need
 to be able to connect each farmer unambiguously to each input dealer.
 We avoid this problem by randomizing at the catchment area level because
 then all dealers within that catchment area received the training (or not)
 and all farmers within that area are potential customers of only dealers
 who received the training (or not).
 A similar argument applies to the second treatment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The resulting layout, with sample sizes indicated in each treatment cell
 (obtained through power calculations that can be found in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

) is illustrated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Design"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The first two interventions are implemented at the catchment area level.
 A total of 112 catchment areas are included in the study.
 Half of these are randomly allocated to the first treatment: all input
 dealers in 56 catchment areas receive the input dealer training, while
 input dealers in the remaining 56 catchment areas function as the control
 for this treatment.
 Data that was collected in three of the study districts indicates that
 this corresponds to about 160 input dealers in each treatment arm.
 Orthogonal to the first factor, the second factor is placed, corresponding
 to the second treatment that is also implemented at the catchment area
 level.
 Also here, in half of the 112 catchment areas an information clearinghouse
 will be implemented, and half of the catchment areas will function as a
 control for this treatment.
 However, this will be done in such a way that balance with respect to the
 first treatment exists in both treatment and control groups for the second
 treatment.
 This means that the treatment group of the second treatment will consist
 of 28 catchment areas that received the first treatment and 28 catchment
 areas that function as the control for the first treatment.
 Similarly, for the control catchment areas for the second treatment, half
 will consist of catchment areas where input dealers received the input
 dealer training and half of catchment areas where input dealers did not
 get trained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the third treatment is implemented at the level of the village, it
 is also important to preserve balance in the orthogonal factors.
 In other words, we need to make sure that an equal number of villages that
 are assigned to receive a treatment against learning failures are drawn
 from catchment areas where input dealers received training as from catchment
 areas where the input dealer training did not take place.
 Similarly, orthogonality should also be maintained for the second treatment.
 Therefore, in each of the four treatment cells formed by interacting the
 first two treatments, 40 villages (347 villages in 130 catchment areas,
 ie.
 2,67 villages per catchment area, so that 14 areas correspond to 37,37
 villages) will be randomly assigned to the third treatment while another
 40 villages will be assigned to the control.

 Simulation, where the experiment is run thousands of times and one simply
 counts how frequently the treatment comes up significant, provides a flexible
 and intuitive way to analyze power.
 Furthermore, instead of relying on a theoretical distribution for the outcome
 variables that takes assumptions and returns an analytic solution, simulations
 can sample from real data.
 In our case, we use survey data from about 80 input dealers that were collected
 in three districts in eastern Uganda in July 2019.
 Furthermore, we surveyed 1,500 farmers in the catchment areas of these
 80 input dealers

\begin_layout Standard
We will investigate both outcomes at the input dealer level and at the farmer
 level.
 We analyze power at the input dealer level first and consider two outcome
 variables: (i) the quantity of seed sold by the input dealer in the last
 season, and (ii) the reputation of the input dealer.
 The quantity of seed that the input dealer sold is a continuous variable
 (kilogram) with mean 325 and standard deviation 454.
 For the reputation outcome variable, farmers rate the input dealers in
 their catchment areas on a scale from 1 to 5.
 A dealer's reputation is then calculated as the average of those ratings
 and treated as a continuous variable.
 The mean reputation of an input dealer in the sample is 3.68 and the standard
 deviation is 0.61.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assignment of the input dealers to catchment areas is done on the basis
 of geographical location.
 Using GPS coordinates of the input dealers, the halversine function is
 used to construct an adjacency matrix, and input dealers that are less
 than 5 kilometer apart are grouped into a single catchment area.
 The 5 kilometer threshold was selected based on visual inspection of the
 map, the size of an average village and reported distance between farmers
 and input dealers.
 This procedure resulted in 68 input dealers being distributed over 24 catchment
 areas.
 In the data we used for power simulations, a catchment area has thus on
 average 2.8 input dealers, with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 6.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also need to assume a treatment effect size for the interventions that
 will be implemented at the catchment area level.
 As we did not immediately find credible studies that evaluated the impact
 of catchment area level interventions on quantity sold nor reputation,
 we decided to define expected treatment effect size in terms of cohen's
 d, settling for a size that is between small and medium, of 0.35 times the
 standard deviation.
 For quantity sold, this means 159 kilogram, while for reputation the minimal
 detectable effect size becomes 0.21.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To determine sample size (defined in terms of the number of catchment areas
 for the first two treatments), the algorithm iterates over different candidate
 sample sizes (eg.
 from 75 catchment areas up to 125 catchment areas with increments of 5
 catchment areas).
 For each candidate sample size, a random sample with replacement is drawn
 from the survey data.
 This sample is then used to run a number (eg.
 1000) of simulations of the experiment.
 In particular, for each simulation, all input dealers that are in half
 of the catchment areas are assigned to the treatment condition and the
 other half to the control condition.
 To the outcomes of interest that are assigned to the treatment condition,
 the assumed effect is added and the analysis is conducted.
 In our case, we are interested in the average treatment effect, so we simply
 regress the outcome on a treatment indicator and record if the coefficient
 on the treatment indicator is significant at the 5 percent level.
 Finally, we determine how often, out of the total number of simulations,
 we were able to detect the effect at the 5 percent significance level.
 This will give us the power associated with that particular candidate sample
 size.
 Power can then be plotted against sample size to obtain power curves.

 looks at power levels for different sample sizes (in terms of number of
 catchment areas included in the study) to detect an increase of 159 kilogram
 of improved seed sold by the input dealer at the 5 percent significance
 level.
 If the number of catchment areas is larger than 93, we hit the 80 percent
 power threshold.
 These 93 catchment areas correspond to about 263 input dealers.

Once we have decided how many catchment areas (and associated input dealers)
 are necessary to detect effects at the level of the input dealer, we need
 to determine how many farmers we need to sample from these catchment areas
 to identify impact of the interventions on that level.
 To make sure we have sufficient farmers to rate each input dealer, we will
 allocate a fixed number of farmers to each input dealer.
 This may mean that we have slightly differing numbers of farmers in the
 different treatment groups, as the randomization happened at the catchment
 area.
 While this may reduce power somewhat, this does not bias impact estimates.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We again use simulation to determine the number of farmers per input dealer.
 As we already determined the minimum number of catchment areas (and correspondi
ng input dealers), we fix the number of catchment areas at this number (we
 will take the most conservative estimate obtained above, namely 112 catchment
 areas or 318 input dealers).
 We then iterate over different candidate sample sizes of farmers per input
 dealer (ranging from only one farmer per input dealer, which would lead
 to a total sample size of 318 farmers, to 25 farmers per input dealer,
 which would lead to a sample size of almost 8,000 farmers).
 The resulting sample in each iterations is used to run a number (eg.
 1000) of simulations of the experiment.
 For each simulation, all farmers that are in the catchment area of input
 dealers that are in half of the catchment areas are assigned to the treatment
 condition and all other farmers are assigned to the control condition.
 To the farmer level outcomes of interest that are assigned to the treatment
 condition in this way, the assumed effect is added and the analysis is
 conducted.
 We again determine how often, out of the total number of simulations, we
 were able to detect the effect at the 5 percent significance level, which
 will give us the power associated to that iteration.

\begin_layout Standard
We consider three variables at the level of the farmer: yield, input use
 and seed quality (based on the rating that farmers give to the seed).
 Maize yield per acre is a continuous variable with a mean of 541 kilogram
 per acre and a standard deviation of 412 kilogram per acre.

Another outcome variable of interest is input use, ie.

The last outcome we consider in our power analysis is the quality of seed
 assessed by farmers.
 The initial quality rating from 1 to 5 is transformed into a binary variable
 with a mean of 0.26 and a standard deviation of 0.44.
 We assume a small effect in terms of Cohen’s d (0.2 times the standard deviation
 or 0.088 percentage points).
 Given this assumption, Figure

 found.
 Ideally, the total number of farmers that need to be included in the study
 is thus 4,770.
 However, finding impact on yields is hard, as this is an outcome that is
 pretty far down the causal impact chain.
 Yields also show high variability.
 Finally, our project is mainly concerned with increasing seed quality as
 an intermediary to increase yield.
 As such, more direct outcomes such as input use and quality are of primary
 interest.
 Further considering financial constraints and logistics, we decided to
 collect information on 10 farmers per input dealer, leading to a sample
 size of 3,200 households.

 believe that temperature control after the seed leaves the breeders is
 crucial, too.
 Inventory carryover and long shelf life further reduce quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During qualitative data collection, we learn that input dealers repackage
 seed to sizes/quantities convenient and affordable to smallholder farmers
 who may not afford buying seed in sizes/quantities packed by seed companies.
 This is very common with OPVs whose packaging come in sizes of at least
 5kg.
 During repackaging however, input dealers pack seed in bad material which
 affect seed quality.
 For example, they repack seed in air tight polyethylene bags (Buveera)
 which affect aeration yet seed is a living material that requires fresh
 air to breath.
 This practice consequently results into seed losing viability in a very
 short time.
 A lot of information which can help track seed quality is also lost during
 repackaging.
 Such information include seed expiry date, variety name, and lot number.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Content
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To determine the content of the seed storage and handling training packages
 and make sure it is locally anchored, we will consult experts from the
 Ugandan ministry of agriculture, from the seed sector and from input dealer
 associations in Uganda prior to the experiment.
 A consultation workshop will be organized in Bugiri and a series of semi
 structured interviews will be organized with experts of different institutions
 and organizations.
 This information will then be process and function as our knowledge base
 for designing training materials.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the workshop or the semi-structured interviews, the facilitator will
 keep the focus on “seed storage and handling”.
 First, the problems are identified by determining input dealers typically
 do wrong in terms of seed storage and handling, leading to farmers ending
 up with sub-optimal seed quality.
 These problems will also be ranked (Which of these problems are most common?
 What do almost all input dealers do wrong? Which problems are less common?).
 In a next step, solutions are associated to each of the problems (What
 should input dealers do to rectify the problem? What are the recommended
 storage and handling practices?).
 The solutions are also ranked in terms of effectiveness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Training material and trainings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the information collected, we will develop detailed training manuals
 that the trainers are expected to adhere to.
 This will ensure standardized trainings.
 We will also create visually appealing posters showing the most important
 best practices that will be given to input dealers to mount in their shop.
 Information will be kept as simple as possible, as

 indicating that presenting recipients with larger menus can trigger choice
 avoidance and/or deliberation such that the information transfer becomes
 less effective.
\end_layout

 It will take place in a location that is easily reachable for all sampled
 attendants within the catchment area.
 For each treated shop, we will invite the shop owner (who is able to invest
 and eg.
 buy manual air conditioning systems which are important for the ventilation
 of the shop) and the shop attendant (who is in charge of day to day activities
 like storing the seed correctly).
 They will be invited one week beforehand via telephone.
 To ensure that all invited attendants come, they will be compensated for
 transport (both, owner and attendant will be compensated) and lunch and
 drinks will be provided.
 As an additional incentive, we will hand out one free seed moisture meter
 per shop.
 Futhermore, the training will take place at a time when dealers are not
 busy with their daily business because farmers have already bought their
 inputs for the first agricultural season but did not start buying inputs
 for the second agricultural season, yet (May 2021).

Our trainers will explain the correct handling and storage practices for
 improved maize seed and the main advantages and challenges.
 This presentation will take half a day.
 The trainers will use the previously mentioned poster that illustrates
 the best practices in a easily understandable and appealing way.
 In addition to that we will provide example seed bags (including blue certifica
tion labels) as material.
 Afterwards they will supervise the dealers rehearsing the more challenging
 practices in small groups, ensuring that every dealer practices at least
 once.
 We will also ensure that every single dealer (ie.
 every single shop attendant and every single owner) has tried using the
 moisture meter.
 The presentation and exercises are followed by a discussion where questions
 can be asked and concerns can be raised.
 Trainers will react to the comments and requests.
 At the end of the training, all dealers will be asked to answer a couple
 of multiple choice questions.
 They will be informed about this test at the beginning of the training,
 which might motivate them to pay closer attention (dealers will be told
 that they will only receive a moisture meter if they answer all questions
 correctly).
 They will also receive a handout which shows the most important best practices
 and can be taken to and eventually hung in their store.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Timing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prior to the intervention, we will collect dealer baseline data in September/Oct
ober 2020 and farmer baseline data in April 2021.
 The input dealer training will take place in May 2021, late enough so that
 dealers are not busy with selling for the first agricultural season but
 early enough so that dealers can use the newly trained handling and storage
 practices on the seeds they buy in June/July 2021, which are going to be
 purchased by farmers for the second agricultural season that begins in
 August 2021.
 At midline in January 2022, we expect input dealers to be more skilled
 and knowledgeable regarding seed handling and storage.
 Due to the better handling and storage, we expect seed quality to improve
 and hence, we expect farmers to have higher maize yields/revenues/profits
 and to perceive seed quality as higher and input dealers as better.
 We expect these positive experiences from the second agricultural season
 2021 to lead to higher seed adoption and volume/value of input dealers'
 seed sales in the first agricultural season of 2022.
 We expect the increased adoption to result in even higher maize yields/revenues
/profits for farmers after the first season.
 Those outcomes will be measured at end line in August 2021.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Input dealer ratings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To measure an input dealer's seed quality and to subsequently disseminate
 this information to farmers, we will set up an information clearinghouse.
 Prior to the intervention, we will collect baseline data of farmers in
 randomly selected catchment areas of the input dealers that are enrolled
 in the study.
 During this baseline interview, we will ask farmers to rate input dealers
 in their catchment area on a number of characteristics.
 To make sure we are talking about the same input dealer, we can use detailed
 location data, names under which they may be known in the community, and
 also pictures of the shop which were collected during a census (See Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Sample-and-data"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 below).
 This information will be pre-loaded onto the tablet computers and the relevant
 input dealers will show up during the interview.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Farmer baseline data including farmers' ratings of dealers will be collected
 in April 2021.
 At this point, farmers will be able to assess seed quality attributes based
 on germination and observing yields, the resistance of the seeds against
 pests etc.
 Based on the responses of all farmers in the catchment area, we will compute
 the ratings for each dealer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Farmers' answers to the questions 69a-f (Please rate this input dealer’s
 maize seed on general quality, yield as advertised, drought tolerance as
 advertised, pest/disease tolerance as advertised, early maturity as advertised,
 f: germination) and question 68d (Please rate this input dealer on the
 quality of seed - good products, no fake seed) constitute the input dealer
 ratings.
 These questions are carefully formulated and include "as advertised" because
 not every improved maize seed variety is eg.
 drought tolerant, ie.
 some of these seed attributes are not quality dimensions of every seed
 variety.
 That is why no dealer should be punished for selling seed that is not drought
 tolerant unless he or she is intransparent about this or even uses deceptive
 marketing practices.
 Attributes like location, price, stock or services (insurance, credit,
 training/ advising, delivery, after-sales service, payment methods, selling
 in small quantities) are not part of the clearinghouse ratings.
 While these dimensions can distinguish good from bad dealers, the focus
 of our study is seed quality, and the clearinghouse rating should make
 the unobservable *seed quality* oberservable.
 Furthermore, farmers could observe these attributes if they wanted to,
 they could stop by a dealer to see eg.
 his/her prices or could ask whether the dealer offers eg.
 an insurance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, what happens if a dealer in a treated catchment area is not rated
 eg.
 because farmers do not know him/her? We could take the catchment area average
 as his/her rating, meaning that we handle the situation as if data were
 missing.
 However, filling in ratings based on catchment area means is not as innocent
 as it seems.
 It is likely that missingness (or a low number or ratings) is not random:
 poor quality input dealers have less customers, so their likelihood to
 get rated is lower.
 Giving them average catchment area ratings inflates the ratings of these
 low quality input dealers.
 Also, in catchment areas with only one or two other input dealers, means
 are meaningless.
 That is why we will not give dealers that are not rated or rated by only
 a few farmers average catchment area ratings.
 We will simply tell the farmers that we do not have information about this
 dealer (implicitly informing the farmer that the dealer is there).
 If a dealer is not rated (only rated by one farmer or two farmers) and
 he or she is the only one in the catchment area, we will pursue the same
 strategy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If dealer A is rated by 10 farmers and gets rating 3,5 and dealer B is rated
 by 1 farmer and gets rating 3,6, we treat dealer B as the better dealer.
 Even though getting many (few) farmer ratings might be due to good (poor)
 quality (missingness might not be random, see precious paragraph), there
 might be other reasons why dealers are rated by many (few) farmers.
 Also on TripAdvisor, having more reviews than a rival hotel does not guarantee
 you will rank higher.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, should ratings be standardized or depend on catchment area or sample
 averages? The following case shows that they should not depend on catchment
 area averages: in an area with poor dealers in which one dealer is a bit
 better than the rest but still poor, we do not want this poor dealer to
 be rated well (ie.
 expose farmers to poor dealers).
 Similarly, in an area with good dealers in which one dealer is a bit worse
 than the rest but still good, we do not want this good dealer to be rated
 poorly (which would be unfair towards this dealer).
 On the other hand, if many dealers receive a good rating, we would throw
 away valuable data if we would only disseminate good scores without any
 variation.
 Therefore, the distribution of ratings should be taken into account (not
 by standardizing but by using quintiles).
 Consequenly, less dealers will get rating 4 or 5, more dealers will get
 rating 3.
 This will strengthen the effect of the treatment on dealer effort.
 If dealers get rating 3 instead of 4 or 5, they will be more inclined to
 improve their scores.
 Consequently, also the effect on seed quality itself will be larger.
 However, the clearinghouse should also have a "signaling effect", which
 might be weaker if more dealers are rating 3 than rating 4 or 5 (dealers
 seems to be of worse quality to farmers).
 Therefore, we will choose the names of the quintiles carefully during rating
 dissemination: if most dealers get a good or very good ranking before taking
 the distribution into account, we will ensure that even a 3 is still communicat
ed as "good" to farmers to not weaken the signaling effect and to disseminate
 ratings as truthfully, purely and as closely to reality as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because around 40% of input dealers are women (?) and women could be rated
 more negatively, we will also test whether there are significant differences
 between the ratings of female dealers and the ratings of male dealers.
 We will control for some potentially confounding variables, like age, education
 level, distances to the nearest tarmac road and the nearest murram road
 (as measures of remoteness) and additionally control for many indications
 of quality (whether the shop is specialized and only sells farm inputs,
 year of establishment of the shop, whether seed is stored in a dedicated
 area, whether there is a problem with rats or pests, whether the roof is
 leak-proof and insulated, whether the walls are insulated, whether the
 area is ventilated, whether the walls are plastered, material of floor
 and lighting conditions where seed is stored, surface on which seed is
 stored, whether maize seed is stored in open bags or containers, whether
 there is any official certificates displayed in the store, cleanness and
 professionality of the shop, whether the shop received any complaint from
 a customer since last season, temperature in the store).
 If we find significant differences (Pr(>|t|) < 0.1) after controlling for
 all this, we have no reason to believe that there is any other reason than
 discrimination for female input dealers to be rated worse.
 We correct the ratings for discrimination if we find a significant difference
 that cannot be explained by quality to not do any harm.
 Therefore, we will adjust the ratings of female dealers accordingly to
 prevent this kind of discrimination.
 We will change the ratings of all female dealers by adding the coefficients
 of the gender dummy to the initial ratings.
 This means that we will regress all seed quality attributes (general quality,
 yield, drought tolerance, pest/disease tolerance, early maturity, f: germinatio
n) on the gender dummy and add the resulting coefficients to these individual
 ratings.
 Then we will do the same with the mean (summary) rating.
 We correct both, the ratings disseminated to farmers and the ratings disseminat
ed to dealers.

Disseminating clearinghouse information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first rating dissemination, ie.
 the first distribution of input dealer ratings to farmers and input dealers,
 will happen in June/July 2021 because farmers buy seed in July/August.
 In the treated catchment areas, farmers will be provided with information
 on all input dealers within that area.
 These farmers will be presented a list with all dealers in their proximity
 containing the ranking of these dealers.
 This way is also understandable for farmers that are not experienced with
 interpreting numbers.
 Input dealers will receive their own general and specific ratings.
 They will not receive the ratings of their competitors.
 Input dealers will also get a certificate to display the ratings on their
 store front, similar to a

 of trip-advisor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Second rating, second dissemination and third rating
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second round of input dealer ratings will be collected during midline
 data collection in January 2022, after farmers harvested in November/December
 and the second season of 2021 is over.
 Enumerators will revisit farmers for the midline survey and collect the
 second dealer ratings in person.
 As Tripadvisor also considers recency, we give more weight to recent reviews,
 we discount earlier ratings.
 The second clearinghouse rating will be disseminated to farmers and input
 dealers later in January 2022 because farmers buy seed in Feburary/March
 and plant seed in March/April.
 Finally, after the first agricultural season of 2022, the third dealer
 ratings will be collected as part of the end line data collection in August
 2022, because farmers harvest maize in June/July.
 The third rating is a post-treatment outcome variable.
 Knowing that the clearinghouse will remain in place for some time will
 motivate dealers to change their behaviour.

I3: Addressing learning failures at the farmer level
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While sowing improved seed should lead to higher yields than sowing traditional
 seed, it also often requires more inputs and management.
 Farmers may be unaware of these requirements, or may even believe that
 they have purchased “miracle” seed, and as a result actually reduce complementa
ry inputs and provide less effort.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 find for example that imperfect knowledge about the management of improved
 seed is a significant barrier to adoption.
 This may lead to disappointing yields, and farmers may erroneously attribute
 these disappointing yields to the poor quality of inputs, which may reduce
 subsequent technology adoption.
 Farmers conflating low product quality with incorrect practices can be
 characterized as a learning failure.
 Learning is important in this context because production functions, yield
 and profit distributions are not known but learned from one’s own experience,
 as well as from observing the experience of others 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "foster1995learning,10.1257/aer.100.1.35"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our intervention addresses a particular learning constraint: Farmers need
 to decide on a variety of factors that might affect yield - the time of
 planting, the amount and timing of water, the choice of technology - and
 observe only the end result, making it hard for them to learn about a particula
r input or practice from their own or others’ experience.
 Our intervention promotes a holistic approach, focusing on creating conditions
 for optimal performance of improved seed.
 By trying to keep complimentary inputs and management practices fixed,
 farmers may be able to distinguish disappointing yields due to poor input
 quality from disappointing yields due to wrong handling and storage.
 They will not conflate low product quality with incorrect practices anymore
 and be able to learn about the quality of seed from their own experience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the access to information is important for learning, providing
 information on the existence and use of the new technology alone does not
 guarantee learning

 According to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "hanna2014learning"

\end_inset

, extension may not lead to (long term) adoption because farmers may fail
 to notice important features of the data.
 A recent article by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 shows that sufficient complementary information needs to be available,
 as otherwise it is impossible to learn about confounding variables.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Content
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar to how the content for the input dealer seed storage and handling
 training was determined, we will consult experts from the Ugandan ministry
 of agriculture, from the seed sector and from input dealer associations
 in Uganda prior to the experiment.
 Also here, a consultative workshop and semi structured interviews will
 be organized with experts of different institutions and organizations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aim here is to gather information to help develop a video to be shown
 to farmers that shows what complementary inputs and practices are important
 to create an enabling environment for improved seed to flourish.
 The facilitator should now keep focus on the use of improved varieties
 and try to avoid capturing general practices and inputs, but particularly
 inputs and practices that are important in combination with improved seed.
 In particular, experts are asked to identify what may result in farmers
 getting lower than expected yields from improved seed varieties.
 Problems may often be formulated as an absence of management (eg.
 when using improved seed, more weeding needs to be done and farmers do
 not do that).
 The problems also need to be ranked.
 Experts are also asked to reflect on specific seed varieties that are common
 in the area as each seed is different, and so recommended complementary
 inputs and practices may differ by seed.
 In a next step, solutions are identified (also for each seed specific).
 This information will then be used to produce a script for the video.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Training material
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This intervention will rely on short, visually appealing videos, shown to
 the farmers on tablet computers.

.
 A script will be written and a professional video producer will be engaged.
 A treatment and a control video will be produced, both show best seed managemen
t practices.
 The only difference is one piece of information, namely that this seed
 management is especially important when using improved seed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Timing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prior to the intervention, we will collect dealer and farmer baseline data.
 Right after the farmer baseline data collection in April 2021, we will
 show the treatment and control videos because farmers start preparing the
 second season in June.
 It is cost effective that the videos are shown right after the surveys,
 as we have to visit the 3200 farmers in our sample anyway.
 We will however show the videos to farmers a second time in June/July 2021,
 so that they are reminded of the best practices and can use the newly learned
 information in the second agricultural season that begins in August 2021.
 Mind that farmers plant seed in August/September.
 At midline in January 2022, we will show the videos to farmers again as
 a reminder but we already expect farmers to be better able to judge the
 importance of seed quality and of combining inputs and proper management.
 As a result, we expect farmers to have higher maize yields and to perceive
 seed quality as higher and input dealers as better (conditional on input
 dealers providing good quality seed).
 We expect these positive experiences from the second agricultural season
 2021 to lead to higher seed adoption in the first agricultural season of
 2022.
 We expect the increased adoption to result in even higher maize yields
 for farmers after this season.
 Those outcomes will be measured at end line in August 2022.

Due to the randomized assignment to treatment and control groups, simply
 comparing outcome variable means of treatment and control farmers and input

 on the outcomes of interest.
 To increase power, we condition the estimates on baseline values of the
 outcome variables.
 
\end_layout

For the first two interventions that happen at the catchment area level,
 we look at impact both at the input dealer level and at the farmer level.

 we estimate a similar equation:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

 is that the

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Throughout the study, we will use randomization inference for consistently
 estimating standard errors in our finite sample.
 In general, we will use two-tailed tests and traditional confidence thresholds
 of 10, 5 and 1 percent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because we will test for treatment effects on a range of outcome measures,
 we will deal with multiple outcomes and multiple hypotheses testing by
 means of two approaches.
 Firstly, we follow a method proposed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "anderson2008multiple"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and aggregate different outcome measures within each domain into single
 summary indices.
 Each index is computed as a weighted mean of the standardized values of
 the outcome variables.
 The weights of this efficient generalized least squares estimator are calculate
d to maximize the amount of information captured in the index by giving
 less weight to outcomes that are highly correlated with each other.
 Combining outcomes in indices is a common strategy to guard against over-reject
ion of the null hypothesis due to multiple inference.
 However, it may also be interesting to see the effect of the intervention
 on individual outcomes.
 An alternative strategy to deal with the multiple comparisons problem is
 to adjust the significance levels to control the Family Wise Error Rates
 (FWER).
 We used re-randomization to construct the joint null distribution for the
 family of outcomes we are testing.
 From this family-wise sharp null, we obtained the corresponding FWER-consistent
 significance thresholds by determining which cutoffs yield 10 percent,
 five percent and one percent significant hypothesis tests across all tests
 and simulations

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section describes the samples to be used in the study.
 Our samples will include input dealers located in trading centers and villages
 (key market sheds) as well as maize farmers that are located in the catchment
 areas of these market sheds.
 The input dealer sample is obtained by including all input dealers of 11
 districts in Busoga.
 These input dealers will be listed during a census that we will do ourselves
 so that we will have a list.
 After the census, dealers will be assigned to a particular catchment area.
 Dealers that are less than 5 km apart are assigned to the same catchment
 area.
 This final list of catchment areas will then be used for the allocation
 of the first treatments according to the design in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Design"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The assignment will be done using a computer algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will also randomly sample a fixed number of farmers in a village connected
 to each input dealer.
 This will be done by asking every dealer from which village most his/her
 customers from.
 If this village was already named by another dealer, the village with the
 second most customers will be chosen.
 Enumerators will be sent to these villages and are instructed to randomly
 sample a fixed number of households that meet the inclusion criteria.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For some outcomes, details at plot level will be needed (for instance, seed
 spacing and seed rate).
 However, farmers often have more than one plot.
 As outcomes on different plots within the same household are likely to
 be strongly correlated and the interventions are assigned at a higher level,
 it may not be cost effective to survey all plots.
 An unbiased estimate of the outcome at the household level can be obtained
 by randomly selecting one plot.
 To do so, we ask enumerators to first list all plots, with names farmers
 use to refer to these plots (eg.
 home plot, irrigated plot, plot near the sugar cane factory, ...).
 The ODK program then randomly selects one plot for which detailed questions
 are asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will measure the key outcomes of interest before and after the treatments,
 so that we can assess the treatment effects of the three interventions.
 The dealer baseline survey will be conducted in September and October 2020,
 the farmer baseline survey in April 2021, both before the second agricultural
 season of 2021.
 The interventions will be carried out before the second agricultural season
 of 2021.
 To assess their impact, midline data will be collected after the second
 agricultural season of 2021, and end line data will be collected after
 the first agricultural season of 2022.
 The baseline, midline and endline surveys will constitute the key sources
 of data for the study.
 We will collect information on a range of outcome indicators at the level
 of the input dealer.
 The key outcomes of interest can be found in the next section.

 This will be done through 10 multiple choice questions.
 Each multiple choice question will have 3 possible answers from which the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will also buy one bag of Longe 10H (the most common hybrid).
 On the basis of this, we will:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
test moisture content (see primary outcomes) (q2-reading)

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
On a scale of 1 to 5, rate this shop in terms of cleanness and professionalism
 (q82)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The interventions may also lead input dealers to voluntarily expose themselves
 to increased scrutiny to signal to farmers that they deliver quality products.
 We thus also ask about membership of business associations:
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we ask input dealers to rate themselves on the following attributes:

\begin_layout Itemize
Reputation – are others recommending you? (q103)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the level of the 
\emph on
farmer
\emph default
, we will also look at knowledge.
 However, as the intervention aimed at farmers is less about creating new
 knowledge and more about changing false beliefs, we ask fewer questions,
 and questions that are more open ended and are only asked in the endline
 questionnaire to avoid priming effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Is good seed handling/management less, equally, or more important when using
 quality maize seed like OPV or hybrid seed? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Please indicate what applies for weeding including removing striga when

t/adulterated? (q25h)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
enumerator: Ask the farmer to mention as many improved maize varieties that
 they are aware of.
 (q26)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The farmer level questionnaire has a set of questions about all the input
 dealers that are in the catchment area of the farmer.
 As this is part of the information clearinghouse treatment, this module
 is only administered to households in catchment areas that are assigned
 to the clearinghouse treatment.
 We start by asking:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Do you know this input dealer? (q64)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Have you ever bought seed from this input dealer? (q65)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Do you know anyone who ever bought seed from this input dealer? (q66)

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then ask farmers to provide ratings of input dealers’ maize seed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In general, does the seed that this input dealer sells germinate well? (q69f)

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, we check if the treatments affect the services provided by
 the agro-input dealer:

 the seed back to this input dealer and get a refund (insurance)? (q70)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Does this input dealer offer after-sales service? (q74)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Does this input dealer accept different payment methods? (q75) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Does this input dealer sell small quantities if necessary (1kg)? (q76)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Variable construction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For continuous variables, 5 percent trimmed values will be used to reduce
 influence of outliers (2.5 percent trimming at each side of the distribution).
 Inverse hyperbolic sine transforms will be used if skewness exceeds 1.96.
 Trimming will always be done on end results.
 For instance, if the outcome is yield at the plot level, then production
 will first be divided by plot area, after which inverse hyperbolic sine
 is taken and the end result is trimmed.
 Outcomes for which 95 percent of observations have the same value within
 the relevant sample will be omitted from the analysis and will not be included
 in any indicators or hypothesis tests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Missing variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we field our surveys, some respondents will not answer one or more
 questions that measure an outcome.
 We will handle missing variables from survey questions by checking whether
 item non-response is correlated with treatment status, and if it is, construct
 bounds for our treatment estimates that are robust to this.
 To be more precise, we will assess the relationship between missing outcomes
 and treatment assignment using a hypothesis test and report these results.
 If p<.05 for the assessment of the relationship between treatment and missing
 outcomes, we will report an extreme value bounds analysis in which we set
 all of the missing outcomes for treatment to the (block) maximum and all
 missing outcomes for control to the (block) minimum.
 If p≥0.5 for the assessment of the relationship between treatment and missing
 outcomes, we will impute the missing outcomes using the mean of the assignment-
by-block subcategory.
