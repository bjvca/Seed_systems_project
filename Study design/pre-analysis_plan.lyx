Demand and supply factors constraining the emergence and sustainability
 of an efficient seed system: A pre-analysis plan
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Despite its potential to accelerate poverty reduction by increasing smallholder
 agricultural productivity, agricultural technology adoption in developing
 countries remains low.
 We research how quality (perceptions) of an agricultural technology – improved
 maize seed – constrain its adoption.
 This document outlines the pre-analysis plan for the entire research program.
 It comprises three hypotheses that will be tested in a series of randomized
 controlled trials among smallholder farmers in Uganda, how we intend to
 measure relevant outcome variables, and what inference criteria will be
 used to assess impact.
 In a first hypothesis, quality concerns are caused by information inefficiencie
s at the level of the seed provider; simply providing information on proper
 storage and handling of maize seed to input dealers is expected to increase
 improved maize seed adoption.
 A second hypothesis conjectures that the quality heterogeneity of seed
 and the information asymmetry between seller and buyer – a lemons technology
 – lead to under-adoption; we will implement a crowd-sourced information
 clearinghouse similar to yelp.com to test this hypothesis.
 In a third hypothesis, we test if sub-optimal adoption is due to learning
 failures at the farmer level.
 Farmers might attribute disappointing outcomes to poor input quality, while
 in reality many input dimensions like the time of planting, the amount
 and timing of water determine outcomes.
 A carefully designed after-sales service that makes these other input dimension
s more salient to farmers will be tested.
 The three interventions enable us to learn about the economic, cognitive
 and behavioral aspects that underlie the perceptions of seed quality.

Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As most of the world's poor are semi-subsistence smallholder farmers, agricultur
e remains a key driver of poverty reduction and pro-poor economic growth
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "castaneda2018new"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Agriculture is an important sector in sub-Saharan Africa, employing about
 three quarters of the population, yet contributing only 15% to GDP.
 Increasing smallholder agricultural productivity is therefore likely to
 increase the income and improve the situation of the poor both directly,
 through increased returns to farming and rural labor, and indirectly, through
 lower food prices and employment generation in non-farm rural enterprises,
 agro-industry, and services.
 Increasing agricultural productivity is necessary to kickstart agricultural
 transformation, allowing excess labor to move to more productive secondary
 and tertiary sectors 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "bachewe2018agricultural"

.
 Relative to other sectors, growth in agriculture is therefore expected
 to reduce poverty most effectively

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the most effective ways to increase agricultural productivity is
 through the introduction of improved agricultural technologies and practices.
 These include machinery, but the Green Revolution has demonstrated that
 large gains can also be expected from improved inputs such as inorganic
 fertilizers and high yielding cultivars.
 These technologies can increase yields, reduce post-harvest losses, mitigate
 climate-related risks, and improve the nutritional quality of food.
 Despite decades of research confirming the importance of agricultural technolog
y adoption for economic development and agricultural transformation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "griliches1957hybrid,foster1995learning"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, adoption remains low, particularly among the poor in sub-Saharan Africa
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gollin2005technology"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 This resulted in very modest growth in agricultural yields compared to
 developed countries, such that differences in yields have nearly doubled
 since 1961 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "magruder2018assessment"

\end_inset

.
 To reduce this yield gap, it is important to identify the drivers of, and
 constraints to, technology adoption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The work of applied microeconomists like Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo
 and Michael Kremer has resulted in renewed interest in hands-on policy
 relevant research.
 For instance, the Agricultural Technology Adoption Initiative (ATAI), a
 collaboration between MIT's Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL)
 and UC Berkeley's Center for Effective Global Action (CEGA) has funded
 a series of field experiments to illuminate what helps and hinders technology
 adoption among smallholder farmers.
 This research has resulted in a new set of answers to the question of why
 some farmers do and others do not adopt technologies.
 Key constraints include poor access to information

This study addresses a recently identified constraint to adoption: the quality
 of agricultural inputs available on the market.
 We specifically explore the (perceived) quality of improved maize seed
 as a constraint to its adoption among a sample of smallholder maize farmers
 in Uganda.
 Maize is an important crop in Uganda, both for home consumption and as
 a source of income.
 However, various factors constrain the emergence and sustainability of
 an efficient Ugandan seed system.
 Recent studies argue that smallholder adoption of improved inputs in Uganda,
 and of improved maize seed in particular, is limited by farmers’ beliefs
 that the inputs are of poor quality - counterfeited, adulterated, or otherwise
 non-performant 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Our study will determine the importance of the perceived quality of improved
 inputs for their adoption, identify the source of these perceptions, and
 test interventions to increase agricultural technology adoption.
 It will bring to light the economic, cognitive and behavioral aspects that
 underlie the perceptions of seed quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Hypotheses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Poor (perceptions of) seed quality may arise at different stages in the
 seed supply chain.
 Poor seed quality may occur as a result of input dealer practices, for
 example poor handling and storage practices, or deceptive marketing practices.
 Or the problem may emerge as a result of smallholder farmer capabilities
 and perceptions, for example an inability to distinguish good from bad
 products, or a lack of confidence in the input dealer or his/her products.
 We test interventions at different stages in the seed supply chain to assess
 the relative importance of each potential cause for low demand for improved
 seed.
 The first intervention targets the input dealer, the second targets both
 the input dealer and the farmer, while last targets the farmer.
 Regardless of who is targeted by the intervention, we will assess impact
 by looking at outcomes at both input dealer and farmer level.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
H1: Seed is of poor quality due to poor handling and storage at the input
 dealer level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This first hypothesis refers to informational inefficiency.
 The lack of information is pervasive in developing countries and often
 leads to suboptimal outcomes for the rural poor

, which summarizes two decades of research on the multifaceted and complex
 lives of the poor, concludes that they often lack information (p.
 268) and name many studies that find that a simple piece of information
 can be very effective.
 Also in the context of smallholder agriculture, informational inefficiencies
 have been found to be important.
 Most studies emphasize knowledge gaps at the farmer level, and the consequences
 on outcomes like technology adoption and production.

 While the need for policies and interventions that strengthen input marketing
 capacity and infrastructure has been acknowledged decades ago 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our first intervention is designed to provide information about correct
 handling and storage of improved maize seed.
 Poor handling and storage may lead to poor seed quality, in turn reducing
 the profitability of seeds and leading to lower adoption by farmers.
 There is ample evidence of input quality reduction at this level in Uganda:
 improper storage and handling 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 test seed along the maize supply chain in Uganda and find evidence of poor
 handling and storage, suggesting that these quality-reducing practices
 are quite common.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We suspect an information treatment and more specifically an input dealer
 training to increase input dealer skills regarding seed handling and storage.
 This is expected to improve seed quality and hence farmers' perception
 of the quality and the seller of the product which might in turn raise
 seed adoption.
 If seeds are of poor quality due to (unintentional) poor handling and storage
 by input dealers along the supply chain, this intervention is expected
 to have a positive impact on these outcome variables.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
H2: Seed is of poor quality due to intentional adulteration at the input
 dealer level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This second hypothesis deals with the information asymmetry between seed
 sellers and seed buyers.
 Indeed, the market for seed in Uganda appears similar to the market for
 used cars as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeauthor
key "akerlof1978market"
literal "true"

\end_inset

’s classic study 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyearpar
key "akerlof1978market"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 This study shows how the quality of goods can degrade in cases where the
 quality is known by the seller, but not (yet) by the buyer.
 This problem can be solved by reducing information asymmetries between
 the two parties.
 While Uganda does regulate seed quality through seed certification processes
 and standards, this mechanism provides farmers with a relatively weak and
 unreliable indication of quality.
 Alternative mechanisms such as electronic verification systems have also
 been experimented with, but the cost of implementation has proven challenging,
 and they depend on the reliability of the underlying seed certification
 system.
 In our study, we will test an alternative, decentralized information clearing
 house that is based on crowd-sourced information and works through reputational
 mechanisms and peer pressure, much like yelp.com or tripadvisor.com.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this second treatment, we will determine catchment areas for input dealers
 and ask a sample of farmers in that area to rate input dealers on a series
 of attributes related to seed quality (and service delivery more general).
 This information will be used to calculate a score for each input dealer.
 Some dealers in the sample will then be given these scores, as well as
 an indication on how they are scored relative to the overall average 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bjorkman2009power"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, this information will also be provided to the farmers in a
 sub-sample of catchment areas.
 This will be implemented as a factorial design, such that we can disentangle
 the effect of the input provider getting the information, the farmers getting
 the information, and the interaction (both input dealer and farmer get
 the interaction).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the previous intervention aims to reduce unintentional seed quality
 deterioration that is caused by lack of knowledge, the clearinghouse may
 also reduce instances where quality is reduce intentionally to increase
 profit.
 Some studies suggest that adulteration is pervasive in the Ugandan input
 market.

\end_inset

 find that nearly one in three bottles of herbicide contains less than 75%
 of the labeled concentration of the active ingredient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Measuring the impact of an information clearinghouse fills an important
 knowledge gap: evidence is limited, ambiguous, and not immediately analogous
 to our specific context.
 Prior studies tend to focus on the aggregation and dissemination of commodity
 price data, expecting that farmers will try to sell in markets where prices
 are higher 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fafchamps2012impact,mitra2013asymmetric,jensen2007digital"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 However, a clearinghouse that provides agricultural price information differs
 substantially from a clearinghouse that shares crowdsourced opinions on
 service quality–including products sold–with both input dealers and farmers.
 At a more aggregate level, crowd-sourcing has been used to improve public
 service delivery.
 For example, in Tanzania, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "cilliers2020can"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 show that a low-stakes accountability program that published both nationwide
 and within-district school rankings improved learning outcomes for schools
 in the bottom two deciles of their districts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It should be noted that a clearing house that relies on crowd-sourced ratings
 may be particularly effective to increase seed quality in the market.
 While prices or the quality of public services can generally be observed
 reasonably easy, this is much harder for the case of seed.
 At the time of purchase, visual seed inspection is limited to seed purity
 and the presence of mold.
 Seed performance can only be assessed after planting.
 Some seed may also be more susceptible to pests and diseases, so the overall
 quality of seed can only be judged after harvest.
 To our knowledge, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hasanain2019no"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 provide the only study that introduces an information clearinghouse analogous
 to ours.
 They find that farmers who use a clearinghouse for veterinarian ratings
 in Pakistan enjoy 25 percent a higher success rate of artificial insemination.
 It is interesting to note that this impact seems mostly due to increased
 veterinarian effort and not due to farmers switching from veterinaries
 that receive poor ratings to veterinaries that receive good ratings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With regard to this information clearing house intervention, we anticipate
 different mechanisms to be at work.
 First, farmers that do not buy improved seed may start buying when they
 see that the quality of the input dealer in their vicinity is better than
 expected (eg.
 above average).
 Furthermore, farmers may switch from low rated input dealers to highest
 rated input dealers.
 Furthermore, the clearing house could raise the input dealer's effort as
 he/she wants to improve his/her ratings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An information clearinghouse presents a novel solution to the problem of
 asymmetric information in the market for agricultural inputs.
 The clearinghouse may be preferable to regulating quality directly because
 it relies on a potentially lower cost, self-sustaining, and scalable technology
-based approach, and helps to overcome problems such as insufficient public
 investment in regulatory systems, regulatory enforcement, and market surveillan
ce.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
H3: Seed is of good quality but farmers are unable to adequately learn about
 this quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While seeds of improved maize varieties often provide higher yields than
 farmer-saved seeds or seeds exchanged between farmers, they also require
 more inputs such as water, inorganic fertilizer and pesticides, and tend
 to demand more intensive management.
 Farmers may not be aware of these requirements.
 Even more, they may think that improved seed is a guarantee for higher
 yield and reduce management and use of other imputs.
 This may lead to disappointing yields, and farmers may erroneously attribute
 these low returns to the poor quality of inputs, which may reduce subsequent
 technology adoption.
 The problem may thus be rooted in negative experiences which conflate low
 product quality with incorrect management practices.
 This can be characterized as a learning failure.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "michelson2018misperceived"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 find that fertilizers in Tanzania meet the requisite quality standards
 even though Tanzanian farmers persistently believe that the fertilizer
 they purchase from the market is adulterated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the context of new agricultural technology, production functions are
 not known.
 Farmers learn from own experience 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 as well as from observing the experience of others 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Learning involves an iterative process of forming and updating beliefs
 about yield or profit distributions.
 Many researchers have addressed how individuals process information and
 update beliefs when making repeated decisions

 technology adoption decisions.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "gars2019can"

\end_inset

 test whether farmers’ learning heterogeneity is a barrier to adoption.
 They find that even though Bayesian learning is well suited to learn about
 hybrid rice, it is also more cognitively demanding, so that only 25 percent
 of farmers can be characterized as pure Bayesian learners while 40 percent
 rely on first impressions.
 Present-biased learning and relying on first impressions is likely to hinder
 technology adoption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our context, we hypothesize that there exists a particular learning constrain
t of interest.
 Because farmers must make decisions on a variety of factors that might
 affect yield - the time of planting, the amount and timing of water, the
 choice of technology - they cannot easily learn about the quality of seed
 from their own or others’ experience.
 A key remedy to this learning problem is information, but the availability
 of such information alone does not guarantee learning 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "allen2011interaction,hanna2014learning"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 This suggests that the remedy must also make the information salient -
 relevant, timely, and appropriate to the specific problem that the farmer
 is attempting to address with his or her decision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, our third intervention differs from a pure information treatment and
 we will make the correct handling of improved maize seed more salient in
 farmers’ decision-making.
 We will do so by introducing after-sales services provided by the input
 dealer.
 It will involve a series of text messages, phone calls, and visits from
 the input dealer to the farmer and could include timely advise on fertilizer
 application and other crop management practices that are needed to optimize
 returns to improve seed.
 This after-sales service does not only provide information about correct
 use and management, but also ensures that the farmer perceives this information
 as important by highlighting the relationship between the use of quality
 seed, correct management practices and yield.
 This way farmers can learn about the yield or profit distribution if they
 correctly handle seed.
 After-sales services are a simple way to promote more informed decision-making.
 Distributing information in ways that increase the salience of the information
 convey a stronger message about the benefits of the technology.
 Our intervention is built on the growing evidence that encouraging agents
 to pay more attention to available data can profitably affect behavior
 in diverse contexts

 Studying seaweed farmers in Indonesia,

\end_inset

 show that they are unaware of the size of their seaweed pods, even though
 optimization would lead to large profit gains.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The after-sales service intervention might increase seed adoption through
 different mechanisms.
 To start with, it is expected to improve farmers' practices which in turn
 might increase maize yields/ revenues, farmers' perception of seed quality
 and the input dealer and their seed adoption.
 On the other hand, this service might improve the relationship between
 farmer and input dealer and therefore farmers' perception of the product
 and the input dealer, hence adoption.
 From our results we will infer whether suboptimal behavior and learning
 failures by farmers are a reason for low adoption of improved maize seed.

 For continuous variables, 5 percent trimmed values will be use (2.5 percent

 Inverse hyperbolic sine transforms will be used if skewness exceeds 1.96.
 Trimming will always be done on end results.
 For instance, if the outcome is yield at the plot level, then production
 will first be divided by plot area, after which inverse hyperbolic sine
 is taken and the end result is trimmed.
 Outcomes for which 95 percent of observations have the same value within
 the relevant sample will be omitted from the analysis and will not be included
 in any indicators or hypothesis tests.

\begin_layout Standard
When we field our surveys, some respondents will not answer one or more
 questions that measure an outcome.
 We will handle missing variables from survey questions by checking whether
 item non-response is correlated with treatment status, and if it is, construct
 bounds for our treatment estimates that are robust to this.
 To be more precise, we will assess the relationship between missing outcomes
 and treatment assignment using a hypothesis test and report these results.
 If p<.05 for the assessment of the relationship between treatment and missing
 outcomes, we will report an extreme value bounds analysis in which we set
 all of the missing outcomes for treatment to the (block) maximum and all
 missing outcomes for control to the (block) minimum.
 If p≥0.5 for the assessment of the relationship between treatment and missing
 outcomes, we will impute the missing outcomes using the mean of the assignment-

 For some outcomes, details at plot level will be needed (for instance,
 for the use of improved seed).
 However, farmers often have more than one plot.
 As outcomes on different plots within the same household are likely to
 be strongly correlated and the interventions are assigned at a higher level,
 it may not be cost effective to survey all plots.
 An unbiased estimate of the outcome at the household level can be obtained
 by randomly selecting one plot.
 To do so, we ask enumerators to first list all plots, with names to which
 farmers refer to the plots (eg.
 home plot, irrigated plot, plot near the sugar cane factory,...).
 The ODK program then randomly selects one plot for which detailed questions
 are asked.
 We have piloted this method and it seems to work very well.

 We will measure the key outcomes of interest before and after the treatments,

 The interventions will be carried out before the first agricultural season
 of 2021.
 To assess their impact, end line data will be collected after the second
 agricultural season of 2021.
 The baseline and endline surveys will constitute the key sources of data
 for the study.
 We will collect information on a range of outcome indicators at the level
 of the input dealer.
 The key outcomes of interest include information on input dealer skill/knowledg

 perception, farmers' seed adoption, input dealers' volume/value/price of
 seed sales, number/share of farmers switching input dealers, input dealer's

 GPS coordinates • all names of the dealer a farmer might have in mind (name

 All interventions will be implemented at the level of the input dealer

 A total of four interventions will be cross-randomized into a 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{4}$
\end_inset

 factorial design.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The information clearing house will be composed of two factors with two
 levels each.
 A first factor concerns rater feedback at the level of the input dealers:
 in a subset of catchment areas, farmer ratings of input dealers are revealed
 to input dealers (and in a subset, ratings are not revealed to the input
 dealer).
 The second factor concerns rater feedback at the level of the farmers:
 in a subset of catchment areas, ratings are revealed to farmers (and in
 a subset of catchment ares, ratings are not revealed to farmers).
 This is done in a crossed designs such that there are also subgroups where
 both input dealers and farmers get rater feedback, as well as catchment
 areas where no feedback at all was given.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we want to be powered to identify the interaction between these two factors,
 we propose the sample size in Figure

 Power simulations in Section

 show that we need about 140 catchment areas got get acceptable power to
 detect a reasonable effect.
 As such, we make sure that we include sufficient catchment areas in each
 treatment interactions cell.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Factorial designs allow recycling of treated units in the orthogonal factor
 to be used as controls.
 As such, to estimate main effects – the impact of giving ratings to dealers,
 the impact of giving ratings to farmers – less catchment areas are needed.
 For example, to estimate the impact of giving ratings to dealers, we can
 compare 212 catchment areas where ratings were given to dealers (of which
 in 140 catchment areas farmers were also given the ratings) to 212 catchment
 areas where ratings were not given to dealers (of which in 72 catchment
 areas farmers were also given these ratings).
 Similarly, to estimate the impact of revealing dealer ratings to farmers,
 we can compare 212 catchment areas where ratings were revealed to farmers
 (of which in 140 catchment areas these ratings were also revealed to input
 dealers themselves) to 212 catchment areas where dealer ratings were not
 provided to farmers (of which in 72 these ratings were also revealed to
 input dealers themselves).

Treatments related to the first hypothesis – training agro-input dealers
 on seed storage and handling – will be added as a third factor to the 2x2
 design to form a

 Here, we are only interested in the main effects.
 In each treatment cell in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, all input dealers in half of the catchment areas will be allocated to
 the input dealer training, while the others will not receive the training,
 thus adding a third dimension to the design.
 This is illustrated in the extensive form of the experiment in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Extensive-form"

 As we only need about 280 catchment areas, we only treat 36 catchment areas
 of the 140 catchment areas that are allocated to the interaction of the
 two previous factors (and so 140-36 = 104 catchment areas end up as controls).
 For similar reasons, we only treat 36 catchment areas from the areas where
 neither farmer nor input dealer received rater feedback.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the treatments to test the third hypothesis will be added as a
 fourth factor to get a

 For similar reasons as above, we only need to treat 18 catchment areas
 from the 104 catchment areas that are allocated to the interaction of the
 two previous factors and was not allocated to the input dealer training
 (and so 104-18 = 86 catchment areas end up as controls).
 For similar reasons, we only treat 18 catchment areas from the areas where
 neither farmer nor input dealer received rater feedback and no input dealer
 received training.

Level of randomization: We decided to randomize at the level of the catchment
 area, not at the level of the dealer, for two main reasons: 1) It’s more
 ethical/fair.
 If we’d randomize at dealer level, one dealer might get scored and get
 a good score and his/her neighbor dealer might not get scored.
 As a result, many farmers might choose the dealer with the good score and
 against the dealer without any score.
 This would result in a considerable competitive disadvantage for the dealer
 that didn’t get the chance to get scored due to randomization.
 Randomization at the catchment area level ensures that we don’t do any
 harm of this kind.
 2) We can measure an effect on farmer outcomes.
 If we’d randomize at dealer level, one dealer might get scored and his/her
 neighbor dealer might not get scored.
 It will be difficult/unfeasible to know which farmers belong to the scored
 dealer and which farmers belong to the unscored dealer.
 We avoid this problem by randomizing at the catchment area level because
 then all dealers within an area get scored/ not scored and all farmers
 within an area are potential customers of only dealers who get scored/
 not scored.
 We can therefore safely conclude which farmers are in the control group
 and which farmers are in the treatment group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
No splitting of the clearinghouse treatment: We decided to not split the
 clearinghouse treatment into different sub-treatment groups (1.
 Farmers and dealers receive scores, 2.
 Only farmers receive scores, 3.
 Only dealers receive scores, 4.
 Neither farmers nor dealers receive scores) because this decision reduces
 our required sample size significantly.
 We only look at “full treatment” (farmers and dealers receive scores) vs.
 “full control” (no one receives the scores).
 It is difficult to include 279 catchment areas and unfeasible to include
 424 catchment areas in our sample.

 to ask him/her for feedback.
 We will improve the poster according to this feedback.
 The final poster will be printed six times in colour and sufficiently large

Training the trainers

Updating handling and storage practices can be bothersome and related investment
s can be risky.
 That is why we have to safeguard that the treated dealers experience the
 training as a reliable, credible, and trustworthy source of information,
 and understand its relevance.
 The social proximity of the trainer may matter.
 I will therefore train "lead input dealers" which are educated and hence
 regarded as experts but also close to the target population, a person dealers
 can relate to.

 their peers.
 This way we hope to create trainers with competence and a good approach

 The trainers will use the previously mentioned poster that illustrates
 the best practices in a easily understandable and appealing way.
 Afterwards they will supervise the dealers exercising the more challenging
 practices in small groups, ensuring that every dealer practices at least
 once.
 The presentation and exercises are followed by a discussion where questions
 can be asked and concerns can be raised.
 Trainers will react to the comments and requests.
 In the end of the training, all dealers will be asked to answer a couple
 of multiple choice questions.
 They will be informed about this quiz in the beginning of the training,
 which might motivate them to pay closer attention.
 They will also receive a handout which shows the most important best practices

Pre-treatment: input dealer scores
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To measure seed quality and dealer effort/service and to subsequently disseminat

 Prior to the intervention, we will collect data on all input dealers by
 employing enumerators who will use a tablet equipped with

\end_layout

\end_inset

 The interview will be held in Luganda/Swahili/English or another local

 These enumerators will ask all farmers 
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

at which dealer they buy seed and if they do not buy any seed (because they
 use farmer-saved seed or seed exchanged between farmers or any other seed
 not bought at a dealer), at which input dealer they would buy improved
 maize seed.
 The answers to this question will enable us to connect farmers and dealers.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To introduce our study, it's probably absolutely necessary to send enumerators
 to the farmers, calling them/contacting them via SMS will probably result
 in too much non-compliance.
 However, these enumerators could only introduce the study and ask for the
 (potential) input dealer of the farmer.
 Clearinghouse information could then be collected later by means of a call/SMS
 (mobile telephone).
 On the one hand, this method would be "closer to reality" because if this
 intervention would ever be scaled up, clearinghouse data collection via
 phone is much more feasible then people going around, asking for information.
 On the other hand, enumerators will have to talk to the farmers anyway,
 so it would be easy to collect this information right away.
 Also if clearinghouse data is collected via SMS, the questions have to
 be very short and simple.
 Furthermore, when we asked farmers/officials how satisfied they were with
 water quality in Mubende, we experienced quite some difficulties with understan
ding, asking them to rate a dealer via phone/SMS might therefore be simply
 unrealistic ...

We will use the following procedures to address survey attrition.
 Attrition is a risk inherent to RCTs.
 For our study, we do not expect much attrition because the surveys will
 be conducted over a reasonably short time period.
 That is why we expect most baseline respondents to also be available for
 the end line survey.
 However, we will take measures to trace missing respondents to further
 reduce attrition.
 We will record names, phone numbers, addresses and GPS information of farmers
 and input dealers in the first round.
 If we find that attrition is more than 10 percent, we will test whether
 attrition is correlated with the treatments, and estimate Horowitz and

Methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the randomized assignment to treatment and control groups, simply
 comparing outcome variable means of treatment and control farmers and input
 dealers provides unbiased estimates of the effect of the interventions
 on the outcomes of interest.
 To increase power, we condition the estimates on baseline values of the
 outcome variables.
 We estimate the following treatment effect equation with ordinary least-squares
 (OLS) to get the average treatment effects (ATE) of our interventions:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Y_{1ij}=\alpha+\beta T_{j}+\gamma'X_{ij}+\delta Y_{0ij}+\varepsilon_{ij}

\begin_inset Formula $X_{ij}$

 is a vector of all the interactions between the different orthogonal treatments

\end_inset

 is a farmer/input dealer-specific error term.
 The coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $β$
\end_inset

 is our estimated ATE.
 No controls will be included in the regression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Throughout the study, we will rely on randomization inference, with the
 difference-in-means as our test statistic.
 The clustered design forces us to use correct standard error estimates
 for observational dependence within clusters.
 
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
How will standard errors be calculated?
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We will use randomization inference for consistently estimating standard
 errors in our finite sample.
 In general, we will use two-tailed tests and traditional confidence thresholds
 of 10, 5 and 1 percent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because we will test for treatment effects on a range of outcomes measures,
 we will deal with multiple outcomes and multiple hypotheses testing by
 means of two approaches.
 Firstly, we follow a method proposed by Anderson (2008) and aggregate different
 outcome measures within each domain into single summary indeces.
 Each index is computed as a weighted mean of the standardized values of
 the outcome variables.
 The weights of this efficient generalized least squares estimator are calculate
d to maximize the amount of information captured in the index by giving
 less weight to outcomes that are highly correlated with each other.
 
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We need to specify precisely which variables will get included in this aggregate.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Secondly, we run an omnibus test to assess the joint probability of observing
 the theoretically predicted pattern of results under the sharp null of
 no effects (Caughey, Dafoe, & Seawright, 2017).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How will we deal with overlapping catchment areas of treatment and control
 dealers.
 A randomized saturation design is one possible approach to optimally design
 experiments when there is interference between units (Baird, Bohren, McIntosh,
 & Özler, 2018).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will also assess the importance of spillovers.
 We will vary treatment intensity per catchment area to assess spillover
 effects.
 In fact, instead of just comparing outcomes of shops surrounded by both
 treatment and control households to shops surrounded by only control households
, we can also look at treatment intensity effects on shops by conditioning
 on the proportion of treated farmers in the catchment area of a shop.

 We use data from a different study, namely …, which contain answers of
 farmers and input dealers in …, a Ugandan district similar to the districts

 Simulations with real data have the advantage that we do not only know
 the real means and standard deviations of the variables of interest but

 us to analyze power precisely.

 We analyze power at the input dealer level first and consider two outcome
 variables, the quantity of sold seed and the reputation of the input dealer.
 The quantity of seed that the input dealer sold is a continuous variable
 and trimmed at 5 percent to decrease variability, i.e.
 the standard deviation compared to the expected treatment effect size,
 and therefore increase power.
 The mean quantity is 325 kilogram and the standard deviation is 454 kilogram.
 Our simulation design randomly assigns input dealers to either treatment
 or control with a probability of 0.5.
 We also need to make assumptions about the size of the treatment effect.
 To our knowledge, there are no studies with interventions at the input
 dealer level, so that we cannot rely on the literature when assuming a
 realistic treatment effect.
 That is why we expect a treatment effect size between small and medium,
 an effect of 0.35 times the standard deviation, here 159 kilogram.
 We then vary the total number of input dealers to see how power varies
 with sample size.
 The graph below shows that under these assumptions, if the number of input
 dealers is larger than 255, our experiments will return statistically significa
nt results 80 percent of the time, meaning that 80 percent of p-values will
 be below 0.05.

For the reputation outcome variable, farmers score the reputation of their
 input dealer on a scale from 1 to 5.
 A dealers reputation is the average of those scores and treated as a continuous
 variable.
 The mean reputation is 3.68 and the standard deviation is 0.61.
 We again assume a treatment effect size between small and medium, i.e.
 0.35 times the standard deviation, here 0.21.
 If the number of input dealers is larger than 265, our experiments will
 return statistically significant results 80 percent of the time, given
 the described assumptions.
 From these calculations we conclude that we need at least 265 input dealers
 in our sample to detect a small to medium sized effect.
 To account for 5 percent attrition, we will therefore survey 279 dealers.

Then we determine how many farmers we need to have statistically significant
 results 80 percent of the time.
 We consider three variables: yield, input use and seed quality.
 Maize yield per acre is a continuous variable with a mean of 541 kilogram
 and a standard deviation of 412 kilogram.
 Van Campenhout, Spielman, and Lecoutere (2020) find a treatment effect
 of 10.5 percent when they investigated the effectiveness of videos as means
 of delivering information on input use and improved maize management practices
 to farmers.
 That is why we assume an effect size of 10.5 percent on maize yields, hence
 57 kilogram.
 Given the distribution of the yield variable and the assumption about the
 effect, we conclude that we need at least 15 farmers per input dealer.
 This is illustrated by the graph below.

Another outcome variable of interest is input use, i.e.
 the adoption of improved maize seed, a binary variable.
 In our data, 63 percent of farmers adopt improved seed and the standard
 deviation is 0.48.
 Van Campenhout, Spielman, and Lecoutere (2020) find an effect of 0.065 percentag
e points of videos to deliver information on fertilizer use.
 If we assume an effect size of 0.065 percentage points, we need at least
 11 farmers per input dealer in our sample.

The last outcome we consider in our power analysis is the quality of seed
 assessed by farmers.
 The initial quality score from 1 to 5 is transformed into a binary variable
 with a mean of 0.26 and a standard deviation of 0.44.
 Because there are no studies that measure the effect of a similar interventions
 on seed quality, we expect a small effect in terms of Cohen’s d, namely
 0.2 times the standard deviation, thus 0.088 percentage points.
 Given this assumption, we need at least 5 farmers per input dealer.

We conclude that we need at least 15 farmers per input dealer to detect
 effect sizes similar to the ones Van Campenhout, Spielman, and Lecoutere
 (2020) found.
 To account for 10 percent attrition, we aim to survey 17 farmers per dealer.
 In summary, we plan to include 279 input dealers and 17 farmers per dealer
 in our study, which results 4743 (279 times 17) farmers we intend to interview
 and 3975 farmers (265 times 15) after attrition.

Updated power calculations: These two decisions have the following implications
 for power: You might think that this means that we need x input dealers
 in 279 catchment areas in our sample.
 You might think that this means that we need 279 input dealers in y catchment
 areas in our sample.
 In fact, we need a sample size between x input dealers in 279 catchment
 areas (upper bound - if the correlation between dealers in one catchment
 area is 1) and 279 dealers in y catchment areas (lower bound if the correlation
 between dealers in one catchment area is 0).
 The final sample size depends on this correlation between 0 and 1.
 Caroline will use Optimal Design to get an approximate sample size.
 Bjorn will use R code to get the final sample size upon his return.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We will calculate how many catchment areas and farmers per catchment area
 we need, while holding the number of dealers per catchment area constant
 (as the mean number of dealers per catchment area we find in the stack
 survey data) and assuming a particular within catchment area (within cluster)
 correlation.
 The is no need to calculate a final sample size before Bjorn’s return because
 we are still concerned about data collection in Uganda as long as we can
 hardly assess the Corona related risks.
 We do not want to carry the virus from village to village while doing a
 census.
