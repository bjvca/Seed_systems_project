Demand and supply factors constraining the emergence and sustainability
 of an efficient seed system: A pre-analysis plan
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Agricultural technology remains under-adopted among smallholder farmers
 in Sub-Saharan Africa.
 We investigate how the quality of an agricultural technology – improved
 maize seed – affects its adoption.
 The research entails three hypotheses that will be tested in a series of
 randomized controlled trials among agro-input dealers and smallholder farmers
 in Uganda.
 In a first hypothesis, quality concerns that constrain uptake are caused
 by information inefficiencies at the level of the agro-input dealer, who
 is assumed to lack knowledge about proper storage and handling.
 An intensive training program is expected to increase improved maize seed
 quality and subsequent adoption by farmers.
 A second hypothesis conjectures that information asymmetry between seller
 and buyer with respect to the quality of seed – a classic lemons technology
 – leads to under-adoption.
 We implement a crowd-sourced information clearinghouse similar to yelp.com
 to test this hypothesis.
 This hypothesis targets the interaction between farmers and input dealers.
 A third hypothesis targets farmers directly, as sub-optimal adoption is
 assumed to be caused by learning failures: Farmers might attribute disappointin
g outcomes to poor input quality, while in reality many input dimensions
 like the time of planting, weeding and fertilizer application co-determine
 outcomes.
 An ICT-mediated information campaign that stresses the importance of paying
 attention to all input dimensions is implemented to test this hypothesis.

Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the most effective ways to increase agricultural productivity is
 through the adoption of improved agricultural technologies and practices.
 These include mechanization, but the Green Revolution has demonstrated
 that large gains can also be expected from improved inputs such as inorganic
 fertilizers and high yielding cultivars.
 Technology adoption remains lower than projected, particularly among the
 poor in sub-Saharan Africa 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 As a result, differences in yields between sub-Saharan Africa and areas
 that experienced a green revolution have nearly doubled since 1961 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 To reduce this yield gap, it is important to identify the drivers of, and
 constraints to, technology adoption.

 For instance, the Agricultural Technology Adoption Initiative (ATAI), a
 collaboration between MIT's Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL)
 and UC Berkeley's Center for Effective Global Action (CEGA) has funded
 a series of field experiments to illuminate what helps and hinders technology
 adoption among smallholder farmers.
 Key constraints identified include poor access to information

 We specifically explore (perceived) quality of improved maize seed as a
 constraint to its adoption among a sample of smallholder maize farmers
 in Uganda.
 Maize is an important crop there, both for home consumption and as a source
 of income.
 While improved maize seeds are adopted to some extent, various factors
 constrain the further development and sustainability of an efficient Ugandan
 seed system.
 Recent studies argue that smallholder adoption of improved inputs in Uganda,
 and of improved maize seed in particular, is limited by farmers’ beliefs
 that the inputs are of poor quality - counterfeited, adulterated, or otherwise
 non-performant 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

).
 Our study will test interventions aimed at identifying the relative importance
 of potential sources of these (perceived) quality issues at different levels
 for agricultural technology adoption.
 It will bring to light the cognitive, economic and behavioral aspects that
 underlie under-adoption of these technologies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Hypotheses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seed quality, or the perception thereof, may arise at different stages in
 the seed supply chain.
 Poor seed quality may occur as a result of input dealer practices.
 This may be unintentional, for example poor handling and storage practices,
 or intentional, for instance by mixing poor quality seed with good quality
 seed to cut costs.
 The problem may also be situated at the level of the smallholder farmer.
 For instance, a farmer may lack confidence in the input dealer or his/her
 products, and the nature of the input may make it impossible for the farmer
 to assess the quality.
 It may also be that the farmer wrongly attributes poor outcomes caused
 by factors other than seed quality to seed quality.
 We test interventions at different stages in the seed supply chain to assess
 the relative importance of each potential cause for low demand for improved
 seed.
 The first intervention targets the input dealer, the second targets the
 interaction between the input dealer and the farmer, while last targets
 the farmer.
 Regardless of who is targeted by the intervention, we will assess changes
 in outcomes at both the input dealer level and at the level of the farmer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
H1: Seed is of poor quality due to poor handling and storage at the input
 dealer level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lack of information is pervasive in developing countries and often leads
 to sub-optimal outcomes for the rural poor.
 As a result, a simple piece of information can make a big difference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "duflo2011poor"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Also in the context of agricultural technology adoption among smallholders,
 informational inefficiencies have been documented, and governments around
 the world invest in public agricultural advisory services to increase productiv
ity in the sector 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "10.1093/wbro/lkh013"

\end_inset

.
 Various studies look at knowledge gaps at the farmer level and the consequences
 on outcomes like technology adoption and production.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1002/ajae.12089"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 show that maize farmers in Uganda appear to benefit from information on
 available technologies and recommended agronomic practices.
 While the need for policies and interventions that strengthen input marketing
 capacity and infrastructure has been acknowledged decades ago 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "TRIPP2001147"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, we find few examples of studies that look at knowledge gaps at the input
 dealer level.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first hypothesis asserts that poor handling and storage at the level
 of the input dealer may lead to poor seed quality, in turn reducing the
 profitability of seeds at the farmer level, resulting in low adoption.
 There is indeed some evidence of input quality reduction at this level.
 In a comprehensive study of the seed supply chain in Uganda, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "BARRIGA2020104928"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 document various issues related to handling and storage that may reduce
 the quality of the input.
 For example, farmers often need smaller quantities that what is in the
 standard bags, and input dealers thus often repackage in smaller bags in
 sub-optimal environments.
 Poor rotation of seed stock and storage in open bags in moist conditions
 or in direct sunlight also reduce seed quality.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test this hypothesis, an information treatment that consists of an intensive
 input dealer training to increase input dealer skills regarding seed handling
 and storage will be implemented.
 This is expected to improve seed quality, in turn reducing risk and increasing
 profitability at the level of the farmers.
 This will lead to more farmers adopting improved seed.
 It is important to note that this hypothesis implicitly assumes that the
 dealer is not aware of the fact that he or she sells poor quality seed.
 In other words, sales of poor quality seed is not intentional.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
H2: Seed is of poor quality due to intentional adulteration at the input
 dealer level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second hypothesis focuses on information asymmetry between seed sellers
 and seed buyers.
 As argued in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bold2017lemon"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the market for seed in Uganda appears similar to the market for used cars
 as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeauthor
key "george1970market"
literal "false"

\end_inset

’s classic study 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyearpar
key "george1970market"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 In such a market, the quality of goods can degrade in cases where the quality
 is known by the seller, but not (yet) by the buyer.
 This problem can be solved by reducing information asymmetries between
 the two parties.
 While Uganda does regulate seed quality through seed certification processes
 and standards, this mechanism provides farmers with a relatively weak and
 unreliable indication of quality.
 Alternative mechanisms such as electronic verification systems have also
 been experimented with, but the cost of implementation has proven challenging,
 and they depend on the reliability of the underlying seed certification
 system.
 In our study, we will test an alternative, decentralized information clearing
 house that is based on crowd-sourced information and works through reputational
 mechanisms, much like yelp.com or tripadvisor.com.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the previous intervention aims to reduce unintentional seed quality
 deterioration that is caused by lack of knowledge, the clearinghouse may
 also reduce instances where quality is reduce intentionally to increase
 profit
\begin_inset Note Note
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A clearing house may affect both intentional and non-intentional quality
 reductions.
 If we combine H1 and H2, can we get an idea of the magnitude of intentional
 adulteration? Intuitively, if we know that knowledge intervention is responsibl
e for a increase in adoption of 15 percentage points, and we find that the
 information clearing house increases adoption by 20 percent, can we claim
 that adulteration reduces adoption by 5 percentage points? Can we get a
 better estimate if we exploit the factorial design (that is, some input
 dealers that are exposed to the clearing house will also get the training,
 so we could argue that they have to know that they are cheating)? 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In Uganda, there are some indications that adulteration happens at some
 point in the seed value chain.

 find that nearly one in three bottles of herbicide contains less than 75%
 of the labeled concentration of the active ingredient.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Information clearing house mechanisms have been studied to some extent,
 but mostly to address market price information asymmetry between smallholder
 farmers and middlemen.
 Assuming that middlemen are better informed about prevailing prices in
 the market than farmers, theory suggests that providing farmers with price
 information increases their bargaining power.
 However, evidence is mixed: while 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 finds that internet kiosks that provided wholesale price information significan

literal "false"

\end_inset

 do not find a statistically significant effect of market information delivered
 to farmers' mobile phones by a commercial service called Reuters Market
 Light (RML) in a neighboring state.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A clearing house that relies on crowd-sourced ratings may be more effective
 to increase seed quality in the market.
 While prices can generally be observed reasonably easy, assessing an experience
 good such as seed is much harder.
 At the time of purchase, visual seed inspection is limited to seed purity
 and the presence of mold.
 Germination can only be assessed after planting.
 Some seed may also be more susceptible to pests and diseases, so the overall
 quality of seed can only be judged after harvest.
 Aggregation of the experience of many users may thus be a particular powerful
 way to reveal the quality of the product.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The study by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hasanain2019no"

\end_inset

, who set up a rating system for public veterinary services in Pakistan,
 is probably the closest to ours.
 They find that farmers who use the clearinghouse enjoy a 25 percent higher
 success rate of artificial insemination.
 Their research suggests that this is mostly due to increased veterinarian
 effort, as few farmers seem to be switching from veterinaries that receive
 poor ratings to veterinaries that receive good ratings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An information clearing house intervention may work through different impact
 pathways.
 First, farmers that do not buy improved seed may start buying when they
 see that the quality of the input dealer in their vicinity is better than
 expected (eg.
 above average).
 Furthermore, farmers may switch from low rated input dealers to higher
 rated input dealers.
 Furthermore, the clearing house could raise the input dealer's effort as
 he/she wants to improve his/her ratings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A crowd-sourced information clearinghouse can be an important institutional
 innovation to solve the problem of asymmetric information in the market
 for agricultural inputs.
 It may be preferable to alternative strategies such as regulating quality
 due to its likely lower cost, self-sustaining nature and scaleability,
 and helps to overcome problems such as insufficient public investment in
 regulatory systems, regulatory enforcement, and market surveillance.

H3: Seed is of good quality but farmers are unable to adequately learn about
 this quality.

In the context of new agricultural technology, production functions are
 not known.
 Farmers learn from own experience 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 test whether farmers’ learning heterogeneity is a barrier to adoption.
 They find that even though Bayesian learning is well suited to learn about
 hybrid rice, it is also more cognitively demanding, such that only 25 percent
 of farmers can be characterized as pure Bayesian learners while 40 percent
 rely on first impressions.
 Present-biased learning and relying on first impressions is likely to hinder
 technology adoption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Erroneous perceptions and false beliefs at the farmer level may complicate
 learning and affect technology uptake.
 For instance, high yielding varieties may be less resistant to particular
 pests and diseases or to droughts than local maize varieties that farmers
 in a particular area selected themselves over the course of centuries
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Is this documented somewhere? Do we have references? During the maize study,
 Fiona, one of my RAs at the time, planted the hybrid the we promoted in
 her garden.
 She said she got much bigger maize cobs than her neighbour who used landraces,
 but that here maize suffered from fall army worm invasion while the neighbour
 had less issues.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Therefore, additional inputs such as pesticides, insecticides and irrigation
 may be needed to bring the seed to its full potential.
 Worse, farmers they may think that improved seed is a guarantee for higher
 yield and reduce management and use of other inputs.
 This may lead to disappointing yields, and farmers may erroneously attribute
 these low returns to poor input quality, which may lead to dis-adoption.
 The problem may thus be rooted in negative experiences which conflate low
 product quality with incorrect management practices and can be characterized
 as a learning failure.
 Consistent with this, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 find that fertilizers in Tanzania meet the requisite quality standards
 even though Tanzanian farmers persistently believe that the fertilizer
 they purchase from the market is adulterated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the present context, we hypothesize that there exists a particular learning
 constraint of interest.
 Because farmers must make decisions on a variety of input dimensions that
 interact in the production function - the time of planting, the amount
 and timing of water, the choice of technology, additional inputs such as
 fertilizer or pesticides and insecticides - they cannot easily learn about
 the quality of seed from their own or others’ experience.
 A key remedy to this learning problem is information, but the availability
 of such information alone does not automatically guarantee learning.
 Limited attention to particular input dimension may necessitate interventions
 that highlight previously unattended-to relationships in the data

To test the three hypotheses, we will implement three interventions that
 are combined in a field experiment where various treatment and control
 groups are randomly assigned to either a treatment or control condition.
 The randomized control trial (RCT) will take the form of a 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{3}$
\end_inset

 factorial design, with each intervention corresponding to one hypothesis.
 To test the first hypothesis, a random sub-sample of input dealers will
 receive training on proper seed handling and storage.
 To test the second hypothesis, a rating system will be set up among a random
 sub-sample catchment areas of input dealers catchment areas, and farmer
 and input dealers will receive feedback on the ratings before the start
 of the planting season.
 To test the third hypothesis, a video that points out the importance of
 combining improved seed with other inputs and careful crop management will
 be shown to a random subset of farmers.
 The treatments are further elaborated in Section

 Impact will be judged by looking at outcomes both at the input dealer level

 investments in seed storage infrastructure, quantity of seed sold,...) as
 well as at the farmer level (eg.
 likelihood that farmer adopted improved seed, maize yields,...)

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Factorial designs allow recycling of treated units in the orthogonal factor
 to be used as controls.
 As such, to estimate main effects, less observations are needed than would
 be the case in parallel designs.
 The factorial design we will use deviates from commonly used factorial
 designs in that the experimental unit will differ depending on the factor.
 For the first two factors, corresponding to the input-dealer training and
 the information clearing house, randomization will happen at the level
 of the catchment area.
 For the third factor that address learning failures of farmers, randomization
 will happen at the level of the farmer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The decision to randomize the first two interventions at the level of the
 catchment area instead of at the level of the input dealer has two main
 reasons.
 Often, input dealers are clustered in markets or trading centers with overlappi
ng catchment areas.
 Randomization at the level of the input dealer prompted ethical concerns.
 For instance, it may be that one farmer gets assigned to the treatment
 group for the information clearing house and receive a good score, while
 his neighbor gets assigned to the control group of that particular treatment
 (and does not get scored).
 Farmers in the vicinity of the two input dealers farmers may be more inclined
 to switch to the dealer with that received the score, even though the services
 of the input dealer in the control group may be the same.
 While, in this case, the rating would lead to a competitive advantage for
 the farmer that got the score, the reverse may be true if the farmer gets
 a poor score.
 Delineating a catchment area based on overlapping areas that are served
 by the input dealers and randomizing at this level reduces this concern.
 While this is less of a concern for the first treatment, we were still
 worried that providing an intense training treatment to one input dealer
 but not to his or her immediate neighbor may be difficult in practice.
 So also for this treatment, catchment areas will be targeted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second reason why we decided to randomize at the catchment area level
 is because we also want to measure the effect of the first two treatments
 at the level of the farmer.
 For example, if we would randomize the input dealer training at dealer
 level, one dealer might be trained but his or her neighbor not.
 If we want to know if the dealer training leads to increased adoption of
 improved seed among farmers in the vicinity of an input dealer, we need
 to be able to connect each farmer unambiguously to each input dealer.
 We avoid this problem by randomizing at the catchment area level because
 then all dealers within that catchment area received the training (or not)
 and all farmers within that area are potential customers of only dealers
 who received the training (or not).
 A similar argument applies to the second treatment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The resulting layout, with sample size indicated in each treatment cell
 (obtained through power calculations that are in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Power-Analysis-Simulations"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) is illustrated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Design"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The first two interventions are implemented at the catchment area.
 A total of 112 catchment areas are included in the study.
 Half of these are randomly allocated to the first treatment: all input
 dealers in 56 catchment areas receive the input dealer training, while
 input dealers in the remaining 56 catchment areas function as the control
 for this treatment.
 Data that was collected in three of the study districts indicates that
 this corresponds to about 160 input dealers in each treatment arm.
 Orthogonal to the first factor, the second factor is placed, corresponding
 to the second treatment that is also implemented at the catchment area
 level.
 Also here, in half of the 112 catchment areas an information clearing house
 will be implemented, and half of the catchment areas will function as a
 control for this treatment.
 However, this will be done in such a way that balance with respect to the
 first treatment exists in both treatment and control groups for the second
 treatment.
 This means that the treatment group of the second treatment will consist
 of 28 catchment areas that received the first treatment an 28 catchment
 areas that function as the control for the first treatment.
 Similarly, for the control catchment areas for the second treatment, half
 will consist of catchment areas where input dealers received the input
 dealer training and half of catchment areas where input dealers did not
 get trained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the third treatment is implemented at the level of the farmer, it
 is also important to preserve balance in the orthogonal factors.
 In other words, we need to make sure that an equal number of farmers that
 are assigned to receive a treatment against learning failures are drawn
 from catchment areas where input dealers received training as from catchment
 areas where the input dealer training did not take place.
 Similarly, orthogonality should also be maintained for the second treatment.
 Therefore, in each of the four treatment cells formed by interacting the
 first two treatments, 400 farmers (10 farmers per input dealer or about
 28 farmers per catchment area) will be randomly assigned to the third treatment
 while another 400 farmers will be assigned to the control.

 Simulation, where the experiment is run thousands of times and one simply
 counts how frequently the treatment comes up significant, provides a flexible
 and intuitive way to analyze power.
 Furthermore, instead of relying on a theoretical distribution for the outcome
 variables that takes assumptions and returns an analytic solution, simulations
 can sample from real data.
 In our case, we use survey data from about 80 input dealers that was collected
 in three districts in eastern Uganda in July 2019.
 Furthermore, we surveyed 1,500 farmers in the catchment areas of these
 80 input dealers

\begin_layout Standard
We will investigate both outcomes at the input dealer level and at the farmer
 level.
 We analyze power at the input dealer level first and consider two outcome
 variables: (i) the quantity of seed sold by the input dealer of the last
 season, and (ii) the reputation of the input dealer.
 The quantity of seed that the input dealer sold is a continuous variable
 (kilogram) with mean 325 and standard deviation 454.
 For the reputation outcome variable, farmers score the input dealers in
 their catchment areas on a scale from 1 to 5.
 A dealer's reputation is then calculated as the average of those scores
 and treated as a continuous variable.
 The mean reputation of an input dealer in the sample is 3.68 and the standard
 deviation is 0.61.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assignment of the input dealers to catchment areas is done on the basis
 of geographical location.
 Using GPS coordinates of the input dealers, the halversine function is
 used to construct an adjacency matrix, and input dealers that are less
 than 5 kilometer apart are grouped into a single catchment area.
 The 5 kilometer threshold was selected based on visual inspection on the
 map, the size of an average village and reported distance between farmer
 and input dealers.
 This procedure resulted into 68 input dealers being distributed over 24
 catchment areas.
 A catchment area has thus on average 2.8 input dealer, with a minimum of
 1 and a maximum of 6.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also need to assume a treatment effect size for the interventions that
 will be implemented at the catchment area.
 As we did not immediately find credible studies that evaluated the impact
 of catchment area level interventions on quantity sold nor reputation,
 we decided to define expected treatment effect size in terms of cohen's
 d, settling for a size that is between small and medium, of 0.35 times the
 standard deviation.
 For quantity sold, this means 159 kilogram, while for reputation the minimal
 detectable effect size becomes 0.21.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To determine sample size (defined in terms of the number of catchment areas
 for the first two treatments), the algorithm iterates over different candidate
 sample sizes (eg from 75 catchment areas up to 125 catchment areas with
 increments of 5 catchment areas).
 For each candidate sample size, a random sample with replacement is drawn
 from the survey data.
 This sample is then used to run a number (eg 1000) of simulations of the
 experiment.
 In particular, for each simulation, all input dealers that are in half
 of the catchment areas are assigned to the treatment condition and the
 other half to the control condition.
 To the outcome of interest that are assigned to the treatment condition,
 the assumed effect is added and the analysis is conducted.
 In our case, we are interested in the average treatment effect, so we simply
 regress the outcome on a treatment indicator and record if the coefficient
 on the treatment indicator is significant at the 5 percent level.
 Finally, we determine how often, out the total number of simulations, we
 were able to detect the effect at the 5 percent significance level.
 This will give us the power associated to that particular candidate sample
 size.
 Power can then be plotted against sample size to obtain power curves.

 of improved seed sold by the input dealer at the 5 percent significance
 level.
 If the number of catchment areas is larger than 93, we hit the 80 percent
 power threshold.
 These 93 catchment areas correspond to about 263 input dealers.

Once we have decided on how many catchment areas (and associated input dealers)
 are necessary to detect effects at the level of the input dealer, we need
 to determine how many farmers we need to sample from these catchment areas
 to identify impact of the interventions on that level.
 To make sure we have sufficient farmers to score each input dealer, we
 will allocate a fixed number of farmers to each input dealer.
 This may mean that we have slightly differing numbers of farmers in the
 different treatment groups, as the randomization happened at the catchment
 area.
 While this may reduce power somewhat, this does not bias impact estimates.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We again use simulation to determine the number of farmers per input dealers.
 As we already determined the minimum number of catchment areas (and correspondi
ng input dealers), we fix the number of catchment areas at this number (we
 will take the most conservative estimate obtained above, namely 112 catchment
 areas or 318 input dealers).
 We then iterate over different candidate sample sizes of farmers per input
 dealer (ranging from only one farmer per input dealer, which would lead
 to a total sample size of 318 farmers, to 25 farmers per input dealer,
 which would lead to a sample size of almost 8,000 farmers).
 The resulting sample in each iterations is used to run a number (eg 1000)
 of simulations of the experiment.
 For each simulation, all farmers that are in the catchment area of input
 dealers that are in half of the catchment areas are assigned to the treatment
 condition and all other farmers are assigned the control condition.
 To the farmer level outcome of interest of farmers that are assigned to
 the treatment condition in this way, the assumed effect is added and the
 analysis is conducted.
 We again determine how often, out the total number of simulations, we were
 able to detect the effect at the 5 percent significance level, which will
 give us the power associated to that iteration.

We consider three variables at the level of the farmer: yield, input use
 and seed quality (based on the score that farmers give to the seed).
 Maize yield per acre is a continuous variable with a mean of 541 kilogram
 per acre and a standard deviation of 412 kilogram per acre.

The last outcome we consider in our power analysis is the quality of seed
 assessed by farmers.
 The initial quality score from 1 to 5 is transformed into a binary variable
 with a mean of 0.26 and a standard deviation of 0.44.
 We assume a small effect in terms of Cohen’s d (0.2 times the standard deviation
 or 0.088 percentage points).
 Given this assumption, Figure

 found.
 Ideally, the total number of farmers that need to be included in the study
 is thus 4,770.
 However, finding impact on yields is hard, as this is an outcome that is
 pretty far down the causal impact chain.
 Yields also show high variability.
 Finally, our project is mainly concerned with increasing seed quality as
 an intermediary to increase yield.
 As such, more direct outcomes such as input use and quality are of primary
 interest.
 Further considering financial constraints and logistics, we decided to
 collect information on 10 farmers per input dealer, leading to a sample
 size of 3,200 households.

 believe that temperature control after the seed leaves the breeders is
 crucial, too.
 Inventory carryover and long shelf live further reduce quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Content
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To determine the content of the seed storage and handling training packages
 and make sure it is locally anchored, we will consult experts from the
 Ugandan ministry of agriculture, from the seed sector and from input dealer
 associations in Uganda prior to the experiment.
 In particular, semi structured interviews will be organized with experts
 of these different institutions (a list can be found in the Appendix).
 We will ask them about their opinion on the importance of properly handling
 and storing seed.
 We then ask them to go into detail on the different dimensions that input
 dealers need to pay attention to.
 Interviewers can probe (repackaging, open air storage, moisture levels
 and temperature control, direct light (UV),...) if the interviewee is hesitant.
 We will also ask what they think input dealers are doing wrong.
 We then ask them to rank the different dimensions that they feel input
 dealers need to pay more attention to.
 This information will then be process and function as our knowledge base
 for designing training materials.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Training material
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the information collected, we will develop detailed training manuals
 that he trainers are expected to adhere to.
 We will also create visually appealing posters to mount in the shop, and
 handouts with pictograms showing the most important best practices that
 can be given to input dealers.
 Information will be kept as simple as possible, as

 indicating that presenting recipients with larger menus can trigger choice
 avoidance and/or deliberation such that the information transfer becomes
 less effective.
 Input dealers that attended the training will also get an ISSD approved
 certificate.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Training the trainers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Updating handling and storage practices can be bothersome and related investment
s can be risky.
 That is why we have to safeguard that the treated dealers experience the
 training as a reliable, credible, and trustworthy source of information,
 and understand its relevance.
 The social proximity of the trainer may matter.
 We will therefore train "lead input dealers" which are educated and hence
 regarded as experts but also close to the target population, a person dealers
 can relate to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will coach about 10 trainers.
 This coaching will take place in one of the IFPRI office spaces in Kampala
 and take one week.
 It will be held in Lusoga/English.
 An expert will teach the previously defined content as well as the methods
 to pass on this information.
 The lead input dealers will also practice the training, discuss and comment,
 ask questions and receive feedback from their peers.
 This way we hope to create trainers with competence and a good approach
 to teaching.
 At the end of this train-the-trainer week, we will ask all participants
 for feedback, so that we can further improve the subsequent dealer training.
 Trainers will also receive a fee.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Training the input dealers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The district's input dealer training will take place in a location that
 is easily reachable for all sampled dealers within the district.
 Dealers will be invited a month beforehand via telephone.
 To ensure that all input dealers come, they will be reminded via SMS a
 week and a day beforehand, lunch and a monetary compensation for their
 time will be provided.
 They will also be compensated for transport and their accommodation will
 be provided for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The trainers will explain the correct handling and storage practices for
 improved maize seed and the main advantages and challenges to a group of
 15 input dealers.
 This presentation will take half a day.
 The trainers will use the previously mentioned poster that illustrates
 the best practices in a easily understandable and appealing way.
 Afterwards they will supervise the dealers rehearsing the more challenging
 practices in small groups, ensuring that every dealer practices at least
 once.
 The presentation and exercises are followed by a discussion where questions
 can be asked and concerns can be raised.
 Trainers will react to the comments and requests.
 At the end of the training, all dealers will be asked to answer a couple
 of multiple choice questions.
 They will be informed about this quiz at the beginning of the training,
 which might motivate them to pay closer attention.
 They will also receive a handout which shows the most important best practices
 and can be taken to and eventually hung in their store.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Timing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prior to the intervention, we will collect baseline data in September 2020.
 The input dealer training will take place in towards the end of 2020 such
 that the dealers can use the newly trained handling and storage practices
 on the seeds that are going to be purchased by farmers for the first agricultur
al season that begins in March 2021.
 At midline in July 2021, we expect input dealers to be more skilled and
 knowledgeable regarding seed handling and storage.
 Due to the better handling and storage, we expect seed quality to improve
 and hence, we expect farmers to have higher maize yields/revenues/profits
 and to perceive seed quality as higher and input dealers as better.
 We expect these positive experiences from the first agricultural season
 to lead to higher seed adoption and volume/value of input dealers' seed
 sales in the second agricultural season of 2021.
 We expect the increased adoption to result in even higher maize yields/revenues
/profits for farmers after the second season.
 Those outcomes will be measured at end line in December 2021.

Input dealer ratings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To measure seed quality and dealer effort/service and to subsequently disseminat
e this information to farmers, we will set up an information clearinghouse.
 Prior to the intervention, we will collect baseline data of randomly selected
 farmers in catchment areas of the input dealers that are enrolled in the
 study.
 During this baseline interview, we will ask farmers to rate input dealers
 in their catchment area on a number of characteristics (see Appendix 2).
 To make sure we are talking about the same input dealer, we can use detailed
 location data, names under which they may be known in the community, and
 also pictures of the shop which were collected during a census (See Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 below).
 This information will be pre-loaded onto the tablet computers and the relevant
 input dealers will show up during the interview.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Baseline data will be collected in September or October 2020.
 At this point, farmers may be better able to assess attributes such as
 price and input dealer services, but they will only able to judge seed
 quality itself based on germination.
 Therefore, we collect ratings from farmers a second time in December 2020
 or January 2021 when harvesting was done.
 After observing yields, farmers may have updated their beliefs with respect
 to eg.
 the resistance of the seeds against pests.
 This data for the second rating will be collected via mobile phone.
 This will also increase the number of data points that can be used per
 input dealer to base his or her score on.
 Based on the farmers' responses of all farmers in the catchment area, we
 will compute a score for each dealer, as well as an overall score.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Disseminating clearinghouse information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first distribution of input dealer ratings to farmers and input dealers
 will happen in February 2021.
 In the treated catchment areas, farmers will be provided with information
 on all input dealers within that area.
 These farmers will receive a list with all dealers in their proximity containin
g their overall and specific ratings.
 The overall and specific ratings will be illustrated in a way that is also
 understandable for farmers that are not experienced with interpreting numbers:
 we will use symbols like smileys/emoticons/stars/thumbsup/down signs.
 A score that is better than 75% is colored in green, a score worse than
 25% in red and everything else in yellow to further improve understanding.
 Input dealers will receive their own general and specific ratings.

2020 AAEA Virtual Meeting paper session “Role of labeling in reducing quality
 uncertainty of hybrid maize seeds: Evidence from an individually-randomized
 trial in Chiapas, Mexico”: The authors look at seed selection among Mexican
 maize smallholders and find that numeric data on seeds helps farmer better
 to make the right decision than qualitative data.
 Providing information about e.g.
 yield potential in numeric form helps farmers select the most cost effective
 seed.
 I think we can learn from this for our clearinghouse treatment that it’s
 better to provide farmers with a numerical rating of a dealer than telling
 then the dealer is “very good” or “average” compared to other dealers (assuming
 that Ugandan maize farmers can interpret numbers as well as Mexican ones).

\begin_layout Standard
A third round of input dealer scores will be collected via mobile phone
 in April 2021, immediately after maize for the first season of 2021 was
 planted.
 In July 2021, enumerators will revisit farmers for the midline survey and
 collect the fourth dealer scores in person.
 The third and fourth scores form the second rating which will be distributed
 in August 2021 to farmers and input dealers.
 Finally, in the second agricultural season of 2021, the fifth dealer scores
 will be collected by phone and the sixth dealer scores as part of the end
 line data collection, in September and in December, respectively.
 The fifth and the sixth scores result in the third rating, which is a post-trea
tment outcome variable.
 Knowing that the clearinghouse will remain in place for some time will
 motivate dealers to change their behaviour.

I3: Addressing learning failures at the farmer level
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While sowing improved seed should lead to higher yields than sowing traditional
 seed, it also often requires more inputs and management.
 Farmers may be unaware of these requirements, or may even believe that
 they have purchased “miracle” seed, and as a result actually reduce complementa
ry inputs and provide less effort.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 find for example that imperfect knowledge about the management of improved
 seed is a significant barrier to adoption.
 This may lead to disappointing yields, and farmers may erroneously attribute
 these disappointing yields to the poor quality of inputs, which may reduce
 subsequent technology adoption.
 Farmers conflating low product quality with incorrect practices can be
 characterized as a learning failure.
 Learning is important in this context because production functions, yield
 and profit distributions are not known but learned from one’s own experience,
 as well as from observing the experience of others

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our intervention addresses a particular learning constraint: Farmers need
 to decide on a variety of factors that might affect yield - the time of
 planting, the amount and timing of water, the choice of technology - and
 observe only the end result, making it hard for them to learn about a particula
r input or practice from their own or others’ experience.
 Our intervention promotes a holistic approach, focusing on creating conditions
 for optimal performance of improved seed.
 By trying to keep complimentary inputs and management practices fixed,
 farmers may be able to distinguish disappointing yields due to poor input
 quality from disappointing yields due to wrong handling and storage.
 They will not conflate low product quality with incorrect practices anymore
 and be able to learn about the quality of seed from their own experience.

So maybe then it may also make sense that we train farmers in the first
 season.

Content
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar to how the content for the input dealer seed storage and handling
 training was determined, we will consult experts from the Ugandan ministry
 of agriculture, from the seed sector and from input dealer associations
 in Uganda prior to the experiment.
 Also here, semi structured interviews will be organized with experts of
 these different institutions (a list can be found in the Appendix).
 We will ask them about their opinion on the importance of creating a conducive
 environment for seed.
 We then ask them to go into detail on the different dimensions that farmers
 that use improved seed need to pay attention to.
 Interviewers can probe (irrigation, seed spacing and seed rates, weeding,
 fertilizer application,...) if the interviewee is hesitant.
 We will also ask what they think input dealers are doing wrong and ask
 them to rank the different dimensions that they feel are most effective.
 We will combine this information with agronomic studies that test different
 input combinations in field trials.
 This information will then be used to produce.

Timing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prior to the intervention, we will collect baseline data in September 2020.
 The farmer training will take place in January 2021 so that the farmers
 can use the newly trained handling and storage practices in the first agricultu
ral season that begins in March 2021

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It would be much more cost effective if the videos could be shown during
 the surveys, as then we have to visit the 3200 farmers anyway.
 It would be good if we could show the video's twice, also during midline.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 At midline in July 2021, we expect farmers to be better able to judge the
 importance of seed quality and of combining inputs and proper management.
 As a result, we expect farmers to have higher maize yields and to perceive
 seed quality as higher and input dealers as better (conditional on input
 dealers providing good quality seed).
 We expect these positive experiences from the first agricultural season
 to lead to higher seed adoption in the second agricultural season of 2021.
 We expect the increased adoption to result in even higher maize yields
 for farmers after the second season.
 Those outcomes will be measured at end line in December 2021.

Methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the randomized assignment to treatment and control groups, simply
 comparing outcome variable means of treatment and control farmers and input
 dealers provides unbiased estimates of the effect of the interventions
 on the outcomes of interest.
 To increase power, we condition the estimates on baseline values of the
 outcome variables.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the first two interventions that happen at the catchment area level,
 we look at impact both at the input dealer level and at the farmer level.
 We estimate the following specification using ordinary least-squares (OLS)
 to get the average treatment effects (ATE) of our interventions: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Y_{1ij}=\alpha+\beta T_{j}+\gamma'X_{ij}+\delta Y_{0ij}+\varepsilon_{ij}\label{eq:one}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

 is an input dealer/farmer-specific error term

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that we can not control for the farmer level (third) treatment in this
 specification.
 But I guess that will not bias the estimate of beta but only reduce precision
 a bit
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $β$
\end_inset

 is our estimated ATE for the treatment under consideration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the last intervention, where randomization happened at the farmer level,
 we estimate a similar equation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Y_{1ij}=\alpha+\beta T_{i}+\gamma'X_{ij}+\delta Y_{0ij}+\varepsilon_{ij}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The only difference with Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is that the 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{i}$
\end_inset

 is now a dummy for the treatment status of farmer 
\emph on
i
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Throughout the study, we will use randomization inference for consistently
 estimating standard errors in our finite sample.
 In general, we will use two-tailed tests and traditional confidence thresholds
 of 10, 5 and 1 percent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because we will test for treatment effects on a range of outcomes measures,
 we will deal with multiple outcomes and multiple hypotheses testing by
 means of two approaches.
 Firstly, we follow a method proposed by Anderson (2008) and aggregate different
 outcome measures within each domain into single summary indices.
 Each index is computed as a weighted mean of the standardized values of
 the outcome variables.
 The weights of this efficient generalized least squares estimator are calculate
d to maximize the amount of information captured in the index by giving
 less weight to outcomes that are highly correlated with each other.
 Combining outcomes in indices is a common strategy to guard against over-reject
ion of the null hypothesis due to multiple inference.
 However, it may also be interesting to see the effect of the intervention
 on individual outcomes.
 An alternative strategy to deal with the multiple comparisons problem is
 to adjustment the significance levels to control the Family Wise Error
 Rates (FWER).
 We used re-randomization to construct the joint null distribution for the
 family of outcomes we are testing.
 From this family-wise sharp null, we obtained the corresponding FWER-consistent
 significance thresholds by determining which cutoffs yield 10 percent,
 five percent and one percent significant hypothesis tests across all tests
 and simulations

Sample and data
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section describes the samples to be used in the study.
 Our samples will include input dealers located in trading centers and villages
 (key market sheds) as well as maize farmers that are located in the catchment
 areas of these market sheds.
 The input dealer sample is obtained by including all input dealers of 11
 districts in Busoga.
 These input dealers will be listed during a census.
 After the census, dealers will be assigned to a particular catchment area.
 Dealers that are less than 5 km apart are assigned to the same catchment
 area.
 This final list of catchment areas will then be used for the allocation
 of the first treatments according to the design in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Design"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The assignment will be done using a computer algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will also randomly sample a fixed number of farmers in the catchment
 area of each input dealer, again defined as 5 kilometer circumference.
 As farmers need to be able to submit and receive ratings over mobile phone,
 we will restrict our sample to maize growing households that have access
 to a phone.
 Sampling will be done by drawing concentric circles around the input dealer
 500 meters apart and dropping pins at a random location of the circle.
 Enumerators will be sent to these GPS coordinates and are instructed to
 interview the closest household that meets the inclusion criteria.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For some outcomes, details at plot level will be needed (for instance, seed
 spacing and seed rate).
 However, farmers often have more than one plot.
 As outcomes on different plots within the same household are likely to
 be strongly correlated and the interventions are assigned at a higher level,
 it may not be cost effective to survey all plots.
 An unbiased estimate of the outcome at the household level can be obtained
 by randomly selecting one plot.
 To do so, we ask enumerators to first list all plots, with names to which
 farmers refer to the plots (eg.
 home plot, irrigated plot, plot near the sugar cane factory,...).
 The ODK program then randomly selects one plot for which detailed questions
 are asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will measure the key outcomes of interest before and after the treatments,
 so that we can assess the treatment effects of the three interventions.
 The baseline survey will be conducted before the first agricultural season
 of 2021.
 The interventions will be carried out before the first agricultural season
 of 2021.
 To assess their impact, end line data will be collected after the second
 agricultural season of 2021.
 The baseline and endline surveys will constitute the key sources of data
 for the study.
 We will collect information on a range of outcome indicators at the level
 of the input dealer.
 The key outcomes of interest include information on input dealer skill/knowledg
e, farmers' seed quality perception, farmers' input dealer perception, farmers'
 seed adoption, input dealers' volume/value/price of seed sales, number/share
 of farmers switching input dealers, input dealer's effort, farmer skill/knowled
ge, maize yield/revenue.

Census: Once we’ve decided on a final sample size (number of catchment areas
 and number of farmers per catchment area), we will do an input dealer census
 in approximately 8 or 9 districts in Eastern Uganda.
 Then we’ll have a list.
 For the census we will need an application because we want to record: •
 GPS coordinates • all names of the dealer a farmer might have in mind (name
 of shop, name of owner, name of employee, name of son/grandfather, name
 of street/neighborhood) • contact information • “Where do your customers
 come from?” (catchment area) • (picture of the shop)

Standard orthogonality tables will be included in the report.
 At each outcome level (farmer or input dealer), we pre-register 10 variables.
 Half of these are characteristics that are less likely to be affected by
 the intervention, while the other 5 picked from the primary and secondary
 outcomes listed in the next section.
 To test balance at the level of the farmer, the following variables will
 be compared at baseline:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

The ultimate objective of the study is to see how the interventions increase
 technology adoption and ultimately well-being of the actors involved.
 At the level of the input dealer, we pre-register 5 primary outcomes, aimed
 at measuring increased seed sales both at the extensive (total sales) and
 intensive (sales per customer) margins:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
quantity OPV/hybrid seed sold derived from questions on the different varieties
 of maize sold in the last agricultural season - kilograms

 We will also look at production and yield, but we do not pre-register this

\begin_layout Subsection
Secondary outcome variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To identify the steps along the causal chain, we pre-register a range of
 secondary outcomes.
 At the level of the input dealer, we start by investigating changes in
 skills and knowledge, particularly related to seed handling and storage.
 This will be done though 10 multiple choice questions (the exact questions
 will be determined after the input dealer training was developed).
 8 questions will be related to skills or practices that were covered in
 the training.
 Two control questions – related to skills or practices that were not covered
 in the training – will also be included.
 Note that we do not expect answers to these control questions to differ
 between the treatment groups.
 If they do differ, this may mean that the interventions crowd in additional
 learning by the input dealers.
 Each multiple choice question will have 3 possible answers from which the
 input dealer (there will also be a don't know option).
 An example of such a question could be: Under what lighting conditions
 does seed need to be stored? a) in complete darkness b) in diffuse light
 conditions c) in sunlight d) don't know.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a next section, we check if input dealers also apply what they were taught
 in the training.
 Also here, the exact practices that will be checked will be determined
 after the input dealer training was developed.
 As much as possible, we will try to identify practices that can be objectively
 verified by the enumerators, such as the surface on which seed is stored
 (mud floor, concrete floor, pallets, shelves,...).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A next section iterates over the two most important hybrid seed that are
 generally sold in the area (Longe 10H; Longe_7H).
 We will ask for each seed variety:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How much of the seed variety was carried forward from the previous season
 (first season 2020) into the second season of 2020? - kg 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How much of the seed variety was bought by you from any provider during
 the second season of 2020? - kg 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_layout Standard
The same questions will be repeated for the two most commonly traded Open
 Pollinated Varieties (Longe 4 and Longe 5).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Next, one random bag of Longe10H will be tested for moisture level using
 a simple seed moisture meter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The interventions may also lead input dealers to voluntarily expose themselves
 to increased scrutiny to signal to farmers that they deliver quality products.
 We thus also ask about membership of business associations

ons of our interventions.
 Eg can we also look at changes in labour allocations?

Variable construction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For continuous variables, 5 percent trimmed values will be used to reduce
 influence of outliers (2.5 percent trimming at each side of the distribution).
 Inverse hyperbolic sine transforms will be used if skewness exceeds 1.96.
 Trimming will always be done on end results.
 For instance, if the outcome is yield at the plot level, then production
 will first be divided by plot area, after which inverse hyperbolic sine
 is taken and the end result is trimmed.
 Outcomes for which 95 percent of observations have the same value within
 the relevant sample will be omitted from the analysis and will not be included
 in any indicators or hypothesis tests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Missing variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we field our surveys, some respondents will not answer one or more
 questions that measure an outcome.
 We will handle missing variables from survey questions by checking whether
 item non-response is correlated with treatment status, and if it is, construct
 bounds for our treatment estimates that are robust to this.
 To be more precise, we will assess the relationship between missing outcomes
 and treatment assignment using a hypothesis test and report these results.
 If p<.05 for the assessment of the relationship between treatment and missing
 outcomes, we will report an extreme value bounds analysis in which we set
 all of the missing outcomes for treatment to the (block) maximum and all
 missing outcomes for control to the (block) minimum.
 If p≥0.5 for the assessment of the relationship between treatment and missing
 outcomes, we will impute the missing outcomes using the mean of the assignment-
by-block subcategory.
