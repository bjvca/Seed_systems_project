The (perceived) quality of agricultural technology and its adoption: Experimenta
l evidence from Uganda
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Recently, issues related to the (perceived) quality of inputs and technologies
 have been proposed as an important constraint to their adoption by smallholder
 farmers in low income countries.
 Taking maize seed embodying genetic gain as a case, we train random agro-dealer
s to test whether under-adoption by farmers is caused by low quality due
 to sellers’ lack of knowledge about proper storage and handling.
 In a second hypothesis, we randomly introduce an information clearinghouse
 similar to popular crowd-sourced review platforms such as yelp.com or trustpilot.
com to test whether information asymmetries crowd out quality seed.
 We find that the information clearinghouse treatment improves outcomes
 for both agro-dealers and farmers, with agro-dealers receiving more customers
 and reporting higher revenues from maize seed sales, and farmers reporting
 significantly higher use of improved maize seed varieties obtained from
 agro-dealers, leading to higher maize productivity after two seasons.
 The primary mechanisms behind this impact appear to be an increased effort
 to signal quality by agro-dealers and a general restoration of trust in
 the market for improved seed.
 The agro-dealer training does not have a clear impact on agro-dealers,
 nor on farmers in associated catchment areas.
 However, we do find that the information clearinghouse increases agro-dealer
 knowledge about proper seed storage and handling.
 Upon exploring interaction effects between the training and the clearinghouse
 treatment, we also find that the training becomes effective for agro-dealers
 that are also in the clearinghouse treatment group.
 This underscores the importance of incentives to make supply side interventions
 such as trainings effective.

The adoption of new agricultural inputs and technologies (such as seed embodying
 genetic gain, inorganic fertilizers, or agro-chemicals) remains tepid in

 Several explanations for the low uptake of agricultural technology among
 small-scale, resource-poor farmers in low- and middle-income countries
 have been explored and tested with increasing depth and rigor in recent
 years.
 These include access to information about existence, use, and benefits
 of the technology

 build on the observation that farmers generally cannot easily assess quality
 from visual inspection at the time of purchase, so information asymmetries
 between sellers and buyers characterize the market for agricultural inputs,
 in turn crowding out the market for quality inputs in Uganda, similar to
 the lessons learned from

 However, subsequent research suggests ambiguity in whether these quality

 quality

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We investigate some of these issues through a field experiment conducted
 with both agro-dealers and smallholder farmers in their catchment areas
 in the nascent market for improved, high-yielding maize varieties in eastern
 Uganda.
\backslash
footnote{In the context of this study, high-yielding maize varieties refers
 to both open-pollinated varieties and hybrids.
 While the distinction may be lost on some, it is a nuance that is recognizable
 to many colleagues working in the fields of plant breeding and seed sector
 development.} We focus partly on agro-dealers because they are an essential
 marketing channel for inputs and technologies in countries with large smallhold
er farmer populations living in remote areas with poor infrastructure.
 A reasonably dense network of semi-formal agro-dealers provides access
 to seed, fertilizer, agro-chemicals, and tools, and may be combined to
 provide agricultural advisory services and credit facilities, both formal
 or informal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yet small-scale agro-dealers may also be weak links in the supply chain
 for quality inputs.
 For instance, the semi-formal nature and scale of agro-dealers may mean
 they lack knowledge on proper handling and storage of agro-inputs.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "BARRIGA2020104928"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 document various issues related to handling and storage that may reduce
 input quality in the Ugandan seed supply chain.
 For example, agro-dealers often repack seed from larger bags packed by
 seed companies into smaller bags in order to offer quantities that are
 convenient and affordable to smallholders.
 As a result, important information including variety name, expiry date,
 or planting instructions are lost, while the material used for re-packaging---a
ir-tight polyethylene bags---affect aeration, moisture, and seed viability.
 Other agro-dealers sell from open bags, which can similarly lower seed
 viability 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bold2017lemon"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In a first hypothesis, we thus posit that simply providing information
 to agro-dealers will increase seed quality and subsequently improve farmers'
 product experience, ultimately encouraging them to adopt improved maize
 varieties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, we recognize that providing information only to agro-dealers may
 not necessarily remedy the fact that seed quality cannot easily be observed
 by farmers.
 Furthermore, we expect that small scale agro-dealers are subjected to less
 regulation and oversight than their larger counterparts in manufacturing,
 import, or wholesale operations that are situated further up the supply
 chain.
 This means that agro-dealers may still be incentivized---even with training---t
o underinvest in quality management and preservation.
 In a context similar to ours, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hoffmann2021observability"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 examine maize (grain, not seed) in rural Kenyan markets and find an absence
 of incentives for sellers to address food safety problems because they
 are not observable to their buyers.
 The same issue carries into seed markets, and in a worst-case scenario,
 agro-dealers may intentionally sacrifice quality to reduce costs and increase
 profits, e.g., by mixing improved or fresh seed with local or old seed, or
 even with grain.
 There is some evidence that may be consistent with this kind of adulteration
 and counterfeiting in the Ugandan agricultural input supply chain.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But even in cases where agro-dealers provide quality inputs, the fact that
 quality can not be easily assessed by farmers at the time of purchase may
 be problematic if farmers hold negatively skewed cognitive beliefs about
 seed quality sold by agro-dealers.

 show that farmers in Nigeria routinely misperceive the cassava variety

 potentially improve farmers’ investment choices and productivity outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a second hypothesis, we conjecture that making quality observable to
 both buyers and sellers will increase adoption through various mechanisms.
 First, buyers may shift from sellers that sell low quality inputs to sellers
 that provide high quality inputs.
 Second, sellers may start to compete on quality, either by increasing quality
 if there is still room for improvement, or by making the quality attribute
 of their products more salient to buyers.
 Finally, in light of the new information, farmers may adjust their perceptions
 of the quality of technologies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two hypotheses are tested in a randomized control trial (RCT) among
 350 agro-dealers and an associated 3,500 smallholder maize farmers in their
 catchment areas in eastern Uganda over the course of two agricultural seasons.
 The first hypothesis involves a fairly standard intervention where we provide
 a one day training for agro-dealership owners and managers on proper storage
 and handling of seed.
 For the second hypothesis, we build on 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hasanain2019no"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and implement a decentralized information clearinghouse that is based on
 crowd-sourced information on quality provided by agro-dealers which is
 then aggregated and made public, much like yelp.com or tripadvisor.com.
 In particular, we ask farmers to provide star ratings to agro-dealers in
 their vicinity, and use these ratings to construct scores and rank agro-dealers.
 We then disseminate these scores to farmers.
 We also provide the score, together with their relative position in the
 rankings, to the agro-dealers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that the information clearinghouse improves outcomes for both agro-deale
rs and farmers.
 Clearinghouse treated agro-dealers receive more customers and have higher
 revenues from maize seed than control agro-dealers.
 Clearinghouse treated farmers are significantly more likely to use improved
 maize varieties from agro-dealers, and have higher yields than control
 farmers after two seasons.
 Impact also seems to stem from treated agro-dealers who increase their
 efforts and expand the services that they provide to farmers.
 Treated agro-dealers are also more likely to be registered with the Uganda
 National Agro-input Dealers Association (UNADA), perhaps to signal quality
 now that it has been made salient to farmers.
 Finally, we find that farmers in the treatment group rate maize seed of
 agro-dealers in their neighborhood better, suggesting that the clearinghouse
 treatment is also effective in changing perceptions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The agro-dealer training does not have a clear impact on dealers, nor on
 farmers in associated catchment areas.
 Interestingly, we do find that the information clearinghouse increases
 agro-dealer knowledge about proper seed storage and handling.
 Upon exploring interaction effects between the training and the clearinghouse
 treatment, we also find that the training becomes effective for agro-dealers
 that are also in the clearinghouse treatment group.
 This is consistent with

 who point out the importance of simultaneously addressing demand-side constrain
ts to make training more effective.

 While these studies often suffer from methodological issues such as low

 First, by enabling consumers to screen on quality, they can now shift to

 show that commuters in Nairobi choose for the safe busses after information
 on safety records of different busses was made publicly available.
 Second, public disclosure of product information makes it possible for
 sellers to differentiate on quality, and indeed, start competing on it,
 in turn lifting the market out of the low quality equilibrium.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 We suspect that, in addition to the threat of farmers shifting to better

 and a sense of social obligation may even be more important drivers for
 agro-dealers to improve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The article further fits into an emerging literature that tests how crowd-source
d information can be used to to reduce information asymmetries.
 Even though advances in Information and Communications Technology and the
 rise of e-commerce has led to numerous platforms that allow for consumer
 feedback and a variety of websites that aggregate crowd-sourced reviews,
 there is surprisingly little evidence on the effects of these developments.

\begin_layout Standard
We designed an experiment with two interventions (described in detail in
 the next section), and evaluate their impact using an RCT.
 The interventions are randomized at the catchment area level.
 Generally, agro-input shops are clustered in towns, villages, markets,
 trading centers, and other key market sheds, so that a single catchment
 area may be served by several dealers.
 If the catchment areas of two or more shops overlap because these dealers
 operate in the same town, street or right next to each other, they are
 assigned to the same catchment area and treatment.
 Clustering agro-input dealers into catchment areas is done on the basis
 of geographical location.

We use the haversine function to construct an adjacency matrix based on
 GPS coordinates, and shops that are less than 5 kilometer apart are assigned
 to the same catchment area.
 The 5 kilometer threshold was selected based on a visual inspection of
 the map, the size of an average village and the reported distance between
 farmers and dealers in survey data from a previous study of the maize value
 chain that can be found

\begin_layout Standard
We randomize at catchment area level for three reasons.
 Firstly, randomizing at the level of the individual agro-input shop prompted
 ethical concerns.
 In cases where two or more agro-input dealers operate very close to each
 other, treating only one of them may lead to a competitive (dis-)advantage.
 Randomizing at catchment area level substantially reduces the risk of (dis-)adv
antaging shops.
 Secondly, it reduces the likelihood of spillovers from treated to control
 agro-input dealers.
 Thirdly, randomizing at catchment area level allows us to measure the effect
 of the treatments on farmers, as all farmers in the catchment area are
 now exposed to agro-input dealers who all received the same treatment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used simulations to determine the sample sizes for this experiment.
 Simulating provides a flexible and intuitive way to analyze statistical
 power.
 Furthermore, instead of relying on theoretical distributions for the outcome
 variables that make assumptions and return analytic solutions, we run simulatio
ns that (re-)sample from real data that was collected in previous surveys.

We use data from 78 agro-input dealers and 1,529 smallholder farmers in

 Power simulations show that if the number of catchment areas is larger
 than 112, our experiments will return statistically significant results
 80% of the time on a selection of primary outcomes.
 This corresponds to about 318 agro-input dealers.
 Based on further simulations to study impacts at the farmer-household level,
 we decide to collect information on 10 farmers per dealer, leading to a
 sample size of 3,180 households.

Agro-input dealer training

Training content and material
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To determine the content of the training and to make sure it is locally
 anchored, we consulted experts from different Ugandan institutions and
 organizations like the ministry of agriculture, the seed sector, and agro-input
 dealer associations.
 A series of semi-structured interviews and a workshop were organized.
 The experts identified common problems and malpractices, and then determined
 effective and realistic solutions and best practices in seed storage and
 handling.
 We then developed a training manual to ensure standardization and a simple
 but visually appealing poster illustrating the most important best practices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Training
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In each treated catchment area, all shops were selected to receive a training.
 Of each treated shop, both the owner and the shop manager who is in charge
 of day-to-day activities were invited.
 The owner was invited because some of the recommended techniques and practices
 require investments.
 The shop manager was invited because many of the recommendations are hands-on
 practices.
 We handed out one free portable seed moisture meter per shop as an incentive.
 All attendants were compensated for transport, lunch and drinks were provided.
 The training took place at a time of the year when dealers were not too
 busy.
 Trainings were organized in small groups, with on average about 10-15 agro-inpu
t dealers present.
 The trainings took place in locations that were easily reachable for the
 participants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The trainers explained the correct handling and storage practices for improved
 maize seed and used the poster and an example seed bag for illustration.
 Afterwards the dealers rehearsed the more challenging practices like measuring
 moisture using a moisture meter.
 At the end of the training, they were asked to answer a couple of multiple
 choice questions.
 The dealers were told at the beginning of the training that receiving a
 moisture meter was conditional on passing this test, which might have motivated
 them to pay closer attention.
 They also received the poster as a handout which could be hung in their
 store.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The trainings took one day and were organized in May 2021, late enough so
 that dealers were not busy with selling for the first agricultural season
 but early enough so that they could use the newly learned practices on
 the seed of the second agricultural season.
 A timeline is illustrated in Figure

Rating collection and computation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the time of baseline data collection from smallholder farmers, we asked
 them to rate agro-input dealers in their proximity on a number of characteristi
cs.
 Enumerators were guided by an application on a tablet computer that iterated
 through all agro-input dealers in the catchment area.
 For each dealer, we provided the common names that are used to refer to
 the shop, a description of where the store is located, and a picture of
 the store front (obtained during the agro-input dealer census—see Subsection
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Sample"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 If farmers knew the dealer, we asked them to provide ratings using the
 questions which are outlined in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "questions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 For example, we asked farmers to rate the maize seed that an agro-input
 shop sells on a scale of one to five stars on germination.
 Ratings were always collected

\begin_layout Standard
Some may argue that by asking farmers to rate dealers, one also makes farmers
 aware of the existence of all dealers in the area, and that this awareness
 effect potentially confounds the clearinghouse effect.
 In the control group, we thus also iterated through dealers in the catchment
 areas, to make control farmers similarly aware of the existence of dealers
 in their vicinity.
 However, control farmers were not asked to rate dealers as the process
 of rating a dealer's seed could make quality more salient, which we consider
 to be an important aspect of the treatment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the answers of all farmers about all dealers in a catchment area,
 we computed the ratings for each agro-input shop.
 These ratings were translated into words and stars for dissemination, such
 that they are comprehensible for farmers and dealers who are not used to
 interpreting numbers.
 As illustrated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "timeline"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

, there were two rounds of rating collections.
 However, these ratings were not pooled, meaning that the second score is
 independent of the first score.
 More details about the rating computations can be found in Appendix

 provides more details about the messages.
 Also in control catchment areas, farmers received text messages with the
 names of dealers in their proximity, so that they were aware of the presence
 of these dealers.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 demonstrate the importance of these control messages.
 They introduced a

 phone directory with contact information for local enterprises in central
 Tanzania.
 They find that enterprises randomly assigned to be listed in the directory
 receive more business calls, make greater use of mobile money, and are
 more likely to employ workers.
 To separate this knowledge effect from the effect emanating from the informatio
n clearinghouse, we also disseminate control dealer information including
 their names but excluding the ratings.
 An additional advantage is that it is harder for farmers to identify if
 they are being treated or not, reducing the likelihood of experimenter
 demand effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
In person
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The enumerators also re-visited the farmers in our sample.
 For this purpose, we designed a visually appealing dissemination application
 (shown to farmers on tablet computers) which cycles through all dealers
 in the catchment area of each farmer and states: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We wanted to let you know that customers from

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in treated catchment areas.
 The application also showed the stars associated with the score.
 Again, we also cycled through dealers in control areas without providing
 ratings to inform farmers that these agro-dealers are operating in their
 neighborhood.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As it was the case for the collection of ratings, the application provides
 different names under which the shop is known, a description of where the
 store is located, and a picture of the store front to make sure farmers
 associate the rating with the correct shop.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Rating dissemination to dealers

Agro-input dealers received their ratings by means of a report on laminated
 paper which was delivered to their shops.

The back of the report shows more detailed information.
 In addition to the dealer's general rating, it shows the separate ratings
 that the seed of the agro-input dealer received on the different attributes
 (overall quality, yield, drought and disease resistance, speed of maturing,
 and germination) and the average ratings of other agro-input dealers in
 the same catchment area in a table, visualized by stars.
 This shows dealers their relative position in the area and could provide
 an important incentive to improve.

.
 We expect dealers to be more likely to change their behavior if they know
 that the clearinghouse will remain in place for some time, so that they
 will be scored again.
 It could also increase farmers' trust in the ratings.
 Again, the second rating does not depend on the first rating.

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the random assignment to treatment and control groups, comparing
 outcome variable means of treated and control participants provides unbiased
 estimates of the effects of the interventions.
 Note that impact will be judged by looking at outcomes at the agro-input
 dealer level as well as at the farmer level.
 To increase power, we condition the estimates on baseline values of the
 outcome variables.
 We estimate the following specification using Ordinary Least-Squares to
 get the average treatment effects of both interventions:

\begin_inset Formula $ε_{ij}$
\end_inset

 an error term that is potentially correlated withing catchment areas.
 The coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $β$

 For farmer level outcomes a similar equation is estimated, where

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because we randomize at catchment area level, we use cluster-robust variance-cov
ariance matrices that cluster standard errors at this level.
 For outcomes at the farmer level where we have almost 3,500 observations
 in 130 clusters, the original form of the sandwich estimator

 estimator

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In terms of variable construction, we follow some pre-registered principles.
 For continuous variables, trimmed values are used to reduce the influence
 of outliers.
 In particular, we trim 1% of each side of the distribution for agro-input
 dealer level outcomes and 2.5% of each side of the distribution for farmer
 level outcomes.
 Inverse hyperbolic sine transforms are used if variables are skewed, with
 skewness being defined as the adjusted Fisher-Pearson coefficient of skewness
 exceeding 1.96.
 Outcomes for which 95% of observations have the same value within the relevant
 sample will be omitted from the analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We account for multiple hypothesis testing by aggregating different outcomes
 within each domain into summary indices, following

Each index is computed as a weighted mean of the standardized values of
 the outcome variables.
 The weights of this efficient generalized least squares estimator are calculate

 less weight to outcomes that are highly correlated with each other.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 However, interpreting these overall impacts can be difficult while effects
 on individual outcomes show us which variables drive the results and inform
 us about the different impact channels.
 That is why we also report the treatment effects on individual variables
 even though they have to be interpreted with care.

Our sample consists of agro-input dealers, and smallholder maize farmers
 who live in the catchment areas of these dealers.
 The dealer sample was obtained by listing all input shops in 11 districts
 in southeastern Uganda.
 We found 348 dealers, sufficient to detect treatment effects according
 to our power simulations, see Section

 in particular).
 We find that 1 to 18 dealers operate in an area, with a mean of 2.7.
 To connect shops to customers, we asked dealers for the names of the villages
 where most of their customers come from.
 Then enumerators were instructed to randomly sample ten households that
 grow maize in these villages.
 Consequently, about 3,500 smallholder maize farmers were sampled, sufficient
 to detect treatment effects for the outcomes used in our power simulations
 (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Baseline data was collected from dealers in September and October 2020 and

 When enumerators approached a shop, they tried to interview the person
 who is most knowledgeable about the day to day operations, which was usually
 the shop manager.
 The average respondent is 32 years old.
 60% are male and more than 90% finished primary education.
 In 55% of the cases, the respondent is also the owner of the shop.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We see substantial heterogeneity among agro-input shops.
 Some are small informal stores which are located in rural areas and sell
 maize seed only during the planting season.
 Others have many customers, are located in towns and specialize in inputs
 and equipment used in agricultural production.
 The average shop was established 5 years ago and is located 7 kilometers
 from the nearest tarmac road.
 It has 41 customers per day.
 74% are specialized shops which only sell farm inputs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also collected information that would allow us to assess the quality
 of maize seed sold at these agro-input shops.
 Enumerators asked if they could inspect the area where seed is stored and
 noted that there is quite some room for improvement.
 65% of shops have problems with pests like rats or insects and 16% store
 maize seed in open containers.
 When we asked dealers about the services that agro-input dealers provide,
 around half reported to offer credit and extension or training.
 On the other hand, 2 in 3 shops received a complaint about seed they sold
 from a customer over the course of the last season.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also purchased a bag of maize seed.
 However, only 232 of the 348 shops in our sample had seed in stock at the
 time of the baseline interview.
 We measured the moisture in the bag and found that it was 13.6% on average,
 with a minimum of 10.3 and a maximum of 17.4.
 Note that seed moisture content determines whether molds and storage pests
 thrive.
 It is recommended to keep moisture below 13%.
 While 68% of seed bags show a packaging date, only 18% show an expiry date,
 and 8% show a certification sticker.

 reports means in the

sample.
 When approaching a household, enumerators were instructed to interview
 the person who is most knowledgeable about maize farming.
 However, a set of questions deals with the household head, who could be
 or could not be the respondent.
 78% of household heads in our sample are male, 51% have finished primary
 education.
 The average household head is 49 years old.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On average, 9 people belong to one household and share 3 rooms.
 The homestead is located 4 kilometers from the nearest agro-input shop
 and 9 kilometers from the nearest tarmac road.
 The average farmer started growing maize 23 years ago and has 3 acres of
 land for crop production.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Half of the farmers in our sample adopted improved maize seed on at least
 one of their plots last season.
 1 out of 3 bought this seed at an agro-input shop.
 Only 25% applied chemical fertilizers like Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)
 or Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium (NPK) on a randomly selected maize
 plot.
 Productivity is low at about 440 kilograms per acre.

\begin_layout Subsection
Orthogonality tests of randomization balance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test if treatment and control groups are comparable in terms of a set
 of baseline characteristics we include standard orthogonality tables with
 pre-registered variables for both dealers and farmers (Tables 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "balance_dealer"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "balance_farmer"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 respectively).
 Some of these characteristics are unlikely to be affected by the intervention,
 while others are picked from the outcome variables we will use to measure
 the impact of our interventions and explore impact pathways in the next
 sections.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For outcomes at the agro-input dealer level reported in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "balance_dealer"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we find that from a total of 16 comparisons, only one is significant at
 the 5% level for the agro-input dealer training.
 For the clearinghouse treatment, we find two significant differences, both
 at the 10% level.
 This is consistent with a balanced sample.
 For outcomes at the farmer level, out of 32 comparisons, one is significant
 at the 10% level.

\begin_layout Standard
This section presents results on the impact of the agro-input dealer training
 and the information clearinghouse.
 We report effects at the agro-input dealer level as well as at the level
 of the farmers that reside in catchment areas of the dealers.
 Furthermore, we separately present impact one agricultural season after
 the intervention (referred to as impact at midline) and two seasons after
 the intervention (referred to as impact at endline).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We take transparency and replicability seriously.
 All outcome variables have been registered in a pre-analysis plan which
 can be found in the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "American Economic Association (AEA)'s registry for RCTs"
target "https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/6361"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 In addition to the pre-analysis plan, we completed the entire econometric
 analysis on simulated data in a 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "mock report"
target "https://github.com/bjvca/Seed_systems_project/tree/master/papers/mock_report"

 and added it to the AEA's registry before midline data was collected.

The presentation of results in this paper differs somewhat from the way
 it was pre-registered and presented in the mock report (and midline report,
 endline report, and previous versions of this manuscript).
 The pre-registered reports mainly serve to tie our hands, commit to decisions,

 Hence the presentation of results in the pre-registered reports mainly
 determines if the interventions worked or not.
 As such, we included tables of key outcomes along the entire causal chain
 (and combined them in an index) to assess overall treatment impact, see
 Appendix

\end_inset

.
 Other tables then went into detail (e.g., focusing on a particular seed type
 sold by an agro-input dealer or on a particular plot cultivated by a farmer).
 In this paper however, we reorganize the reporting to match a structure
 where we first look at impact on outcomes at the end of the causal chain
 and then look at impact on intermediate outcomes to explore potential mechanism
s.
 While this change does affect the construction of some of the indices,
 overall conclusions remain the same.
 Some of the pre-registered tables can be found in Appendix

 Column (1) provides baseline sample means with standard deviations in parenthes
es below, mainly to get an idea of effect sizes.
 That is why we always provide these averages in levels, even though we
 may report the difference between treatment and control group after using
 inverse hyperbolic sine transforms.
 In column (2), we provide the average treatment effect of the agro-input
 dealer training at midline, while column (3) reports the average treatment
 effect of the information clearinghouse treatment at midline.
 We also report the standard errors below in parentheses and the number
 of observations that were used for the regressions at midline in column
 (4).
 Column (5) and (6) report average treatment effects of the training and
 the clearinghouse treatment respectively, but now at endline, after two
 seasons.
 Also here, we report the number of observations that was used in the estimation
 in column (7).

Impact on agro-input dealers

We start by testing if the interventions have an impact on general business
 operations of agro-input dealers in Table

.
 Sales volume and price, revenue, and number of customers and maize varieties
 in stock are included as outcomes under this heading.
 A measure of sales volume was constructed by asking how much of a specific
 maize seed variety dealers sold in the previous season.
 We restrict attention to the four most popular improved varieties, two
 of which are hybrid varieties (Longe 7H and Longe 10H) and two of which
 are Open Pollinated Varieties (OPVs) (Longe 4 and Longe 5).
 Total quantity sold is the sum of quantities sold of these four varieties.
 We also asked dealers about the sales price of the four seed types at the
 start of the season and then calculated the simple average at the dealer
 level.
 We then calculate the revenue (expressed in million UGX) by first multiplying
 prices with quantities sold and then summing over the four seed types.
 We also include the number of customers that buy maize seed on an average
 day at the start of the season, as well as the number of maize varieties
 that the agro-input dealer has in stock.

Table

 shows that we do not find an impact of training agro-input dealers on their
 business operations.
 Both at midline and at endline, the index is not significantly different
 from zero.
 Looking at the individual outcomes, there is no consistent pattern.
 At midline, we find a negative impact of the training on the average sales
 price.
 At endline, the training seems to have reduced amounts sold, which is also
 reflected in a lower revenue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, we do find a positive impact of the information clearinghouse intervent
ion on agro-input dealer operations.
 At midline, the overall index is significantly higher among dealers in
 the clearinghouse treatment group.
 Looking at individual outcomes, we see that treated dealers sold more maize
 seed at a higher price, albeit not significantly so.
 However, in combination, this leads to revenues that are almost 20% higher
 (and this difference is significant at the 10% level).

 At endline, the positive effect of the clearinghouse intervention seems
 to become stronger, with the overall index now being significant at the
 1% level.
 The effect is driven by a 31% increase in the number of customers that
 a treated shop attracts, which translates into 6 additional customers.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Effects on dealer outcomes at end of causal chain: Business volume"
plural "false"

\end_inset

, we start by looking at sales volumes, prices, and revenues.
 We also focus on outcomes related to stock management, as seed quality
 decreases with shelf-life.
 We asked agro-input dealers how much of the particular seed was carried
 over from the previous season.
 Many dealers reported that they did not carry over any seed, leading to
 low baseline means.
 Furthermore, we asked them to estimate how much they bought from any provider
 during the same season.
 For both varieties, this is slightly more than what dealers reported to
 have sold.
 We expect our treatments to decrease the amount of seed carried forward
 and increase the amount of fresh seed procured from providers.
 We also asked agro-input dealers to provide an estimate of how much of
 the seed stock they lost or wasted during the season, and how often they
 ran out of stock.
 We expect the interventions to reduce both, losses and stock-outs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the variety Longe 10H, we do not find significant effects of the training
 nor the clearinghouse treatment at midline.
 At endline however, all individual coefficient estimates go in the expected
 direction for the information clearinghouse, and when outcomes are combined
 in an index, the effect is positive and significant at the 1% level.
 Results are similar for Longe 5.

One step further up the impact chain, increased numbers of customers, sales,
 and revenues are likely to be driven by an increase in the (perceived)
 quality of improved maize seed that these agro-input dealers sell.
 Unfortunately, the quality of seed is hard to assess, which is one of the
 key reasons why information asymmetries exist and the clearinghouse interventio
n was implemented.
 Nevertheless, to get an idea of the quality of seed sold, we bought a bag
 of seed at each dealer and inspected it on a number of attributes.
 First, we measured the moisture content of the seed.
 In Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Effects on bag of maize seed bought at dealer"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we see that the clearinghouse treatment reduced moisture as expected,
 but the parameter is estimated imprecisely, perhaps due to the smaller
 data set as we were not able to source seed from all dealers and the comparison
s were only made for shops in which the enumerator was able to buy a bag
 of maize seed at mid- or endline.
 We further look at the integrity of the package and whether it shows important
 information such as the packaging date and the lot number, but also at
 the shelf-life and whether seed is in the original bag without any signs
 of damage.
 We do not find that the clearinghouse treatment nor the agro-input dealer
 training affected quality proxies of the seed that agro-input dealers sell.
 However, because our proxies of seed quality are far from perfect

As elaborated in a recent World Bank Blog, assessing seed quality is not
 only challenging for farmers, but also for researchers

.
 The most important seed quality dimensions are analytical purity (indicating
 whether seed is the correct species), germination rate (indicating whether
 seed germinates) and varietal purity (indicating whether seed is the correct
 variety, e.g., a particular variety with specific traits, only detectable
 by DNA fingerprinting).
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "BARRIGA2020104928"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 use laboratory tests to investigate the DNA variation (indicating how genetical
ly similar a sample of seed is to itself), analytical purity, and performance
 of seeds (germination rate, moisture, and vigor) as their measure of seed
 quality.
 Even though investigating moisture is an attempt to test the quality of
 seeds in a quantitative and objective way, this variable is one-dimensional
 and only a weak indication of seed quality.

 and we rely on a smaller sample, we cannot safely conclude that the treatments
 did not affect seed quality.

$^2$The comparisons were only made for shops in which the enumerator was
 able to buy a bag of maize seed at mid- or endline.
 Also, we do not control for the baseline values of the outcome variables
 in the entire table because only 144 of the 179 dealers who had seed at
 midline also had seed at baseline and only 183 of the 265 dealers who had
 seed at endline also had seed at baseline, so that controlling for baseline
 values would reduce the sample sizes drastically.

\begin_layout Subsection
Impact on smallholder farmers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first look at harvest related outcomes for farmers that live in the catchment
 areas of agro-input dealers involved in our study and report the results
 in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Effects on farmer outcomes at end of causal chain: Harvest"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 We start by looking at overall production, the area of a specific maize
 plot, and the production scaled by plot size, i.e., yield.
 We also look at market participation (amount sold, sales price, and revenue
 from maize sales) and how much grain farmers save to use as seed in the
 next season.
 All these outcome variables deal with one randomly selected plot.
 While we expect positive effects on harvest and sales, the amount kept
 as seed enters the index negatively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The coefficient estimates for the overall index show no effect of the agro-input
 dealer training, and a positive effect of the information clearinghouse,
 but only after two seasons of implementation.
 Farmers that live in areas where the clearinghouse was implemented report
 higher production and productivity at endline.
 Yield differences are significant at the 1% level and amount to 10% compared
 to the baseline means.
 Finally, we look at the amount of maize that farmers keep to use as seed
 in the next season.
 At midline, we see that, in line with expectations, clearinghouse treated
 farmers save less grain for seed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To explore the large effect of the clearinghouse on yields, we investigate
 which subgroup of farmers enjoyed most yield gains.
 Rerunning the regression only for farmers who did not adopt at baseline
 led to a coefficient of 56.44 with a standard error of 17.38 (hence, significance
 at the 1% level).
 For farmers that did adopt at baseline, we find a coefficient of 30.79 with
 a standard error of 20.38 (hence, no significance).
 This indicates that the effect is driven by farmers who did not adopt at
 baseline, started adopting due to the clearinghouse, and in turn enjoy
 higher yields.
 Assuming that non-adopting farmers are the less advantaged ones, the impact
 on their adoption and yield is particularly desirable.

To further test this, we look at the adoption of improved maize seed varieties
 as a second important family of outcomes at the smallholder level.
 For the agro-input dealer training, we do not find any effect at midline,
 nor at endline.
 The effect of the information clearinghouse treatment on overall adoption
 as measured by the index is positive and significant at the 5% level at
 mid- and endline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zooming in on individual outcomes, a first key question simply asks farmers
 if they used quality maize seed for any plot in the previous season.
 Here, the definition of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quality maize seed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is up to the farmer.
 We see that at midline, farmers that were subjected to the clearinghouse
 treatment were 3.5 percentage points more likely to answer this question
 with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 than control farmers.
 After two agricultural seasons, the difference between treatment and control
 farmers increases to 4.2 percentage points.
 Related, we ask if farmers bought maize seed at an agro-input shop for
 any plot.
 At midline, we find a difference between the clearinghouse treatment and
 control groups of about 6 percentage points, and this amounts to an almost
 20% increase relative to the baseline mean.
 At endline, the difference is about 3 percentage points, but not significant
 anymore.
 We do not find an impact of the clearinghouse on the amount that farmers
 bought at agro-input shops.
 However, one should note that the sample size is smaller because we only
 ask this question to farmers who bought from agro-input dealers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then ask questions about adoption on a randomly selected plot.
 For the adoption of hybrid or open-pollinated maize varieties, we estimate
 positive treatment effects of the clearinghouse, but the coefficients are
 not significantly different from zero.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Here, we asked farmers which variety they planted in the previous season.
 If a farmer used Longe 10H, Longe 7H, Longe 7R/Kayongo-go, Bazooka, Longe
 6H, Longe 5/Nalongo, Longe 4, Panner, Wema, KH series, or other hybrid/OPV,
 and this seed was not recycled or farmer-saved but newly purchased, it
 counted as hybrid/open-pollinated maize seed.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 As for the more general questions above, we also ask if the seed that was
 used on the random plot was obtained from an agro-input dealer.
 We find an almost 5 percentage point treatment effect for the clearinghouse
 at midline and a 3.6 percentage point effect at endline.
 A related question asks if farmers used farmer-saved seed on the randomly
 selected plot.
 Again in line with expectations, we find that farmers that were exposed
 to the clearinghouse treatment reduced the use of farmer-saved seed, albeit
 only significantly so at midline.
 Finally, we look at the product of the amount and the price of maize seed,
 i.e., the total cost of seed on that plot.
 We see that in areas where the clearinghouse was implemented, farmers invest
 significantly more in seed.

\begin_layout Standard
The information clearinghouse is a unique intervention because it solves
 a variety of potentially interlinked problems simultaneously.
 If the quality of maize seed at agro-input shops is sufficient but some
 farmers think that dealers provide sub-standard quality, a clearinghouse
 may correct their perceptions.
 If the quality of seed differs between agro-input dealers, it provides
 farmers with information that may help them to switch to dealers that provide
 better products.
 Furthermore, the rating system is expected to provide a direct incentive
 to agro-input dealers to stay ahead of immediate competitors.
 For the agro-input dealer training, the underlying mechanism is increased
 knowledge.
 In this section, we investigate the relative importance of these different
 impact pathways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Dealer knowledge
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary mechanism underlying the agro-input dealer training is learning,
 which is in turn expected to increase knowledge of treated dealers.
 To test if the interventions affect knowledge at the agro-input dealer
 level, we construct two indices that summarize different measures of knowledge.
 The first index aims to measure knowledge about seed storage and handling
 and tests if dealers retain the information that was provided during the
 training, using a short multiple choice quiz of five questions.
 The questions test knowledge related to seed carryover between agricultural
 seasons, how seed should be stored after repackaging, how seed should be
 stored in the storeroom, and whether seed should be repackaged.
 The questions, the options presented to farmers, and the correct answers
 are outlined in Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "A.4 Multiple choice questions to measure dealer knowledge"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and all variables constituting this index are self-reported.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second knowledge index does not focus on seed handling recommendations,
 but aims to capture knowledge about seed more broadly.
 We again use multiple choice questions to test if dealers know which seed
 variety to recommend if a farmer complains about poor soil or lack of rain,
 if a farmer is late for planting, and whether they know what to tell clients
 who inquire about the yield benefits of hybrid seed.
 Again, the questions and (correct) answer options are explained in Appendix
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "A.4 Multiple choice questions to measure dealer knowledge"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and all variables in this index are self-reported.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Effects on dealer knowledge"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 suggests a positive impact of the agro-input dealer training on knowledge
 at midline, but the coefficient is just not significant at the 10% level.
 The (insignificant) effect of the training is strongest at midline, which
 seems reasonable as the training was organized only once at the start of
 the study, see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "timeline"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Interestingly, we find knowledge effects from the clearinghouse treatment,
 particularly when it comes to dealer knowledge related to seed storage
 seed and handling.
 This effect becomes stronger over time, which again seems reasonable as
 this treatment is repeated over several agricultural seasons.
 As agro-input dealers become aware of the recurrent nature of the ratings,
 they may try to improve the quality of their products by searching for
 information on better ways to store and handle seed.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above suggests that providing only knowledge through trainings is unlikely
 to improve outcomes.
 However, if dealers have incentives to improve quality, they may respond
 by actively seeking out information.
 Together, this suggests that extra knowledge is only useful if agro-input
 dealers are also motivated to put it into practice.
 To further look into this, we exploit the factorial design, where a random
 subset of agro-input dealers was assigned to both, the training and the
 clearinghouse treatment group.
 We indeed find a significant positive interaction effect on key outcomes
 at the agro-input dealer level at endline (most notably on the overall
 operations index, as in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Effects on dealer outcomes at end of causal chain: Business volume"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, and the overall index of primary dealer outcomes, as in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Effects on primary dealer outcomes"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The positive interaction effect seems to be driven by significant improvements
 in efforts and practices (as in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Effects on dealer efforts"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 This confirms that if a clearinghouse encourages dealers to excel, they
 are more likely to put the seed handling practices that they were taught
 during the training into practice.
 If we look at knowledge in particular, we also find an interesting interaction
 effect on the index of dealer knowledge about seed at midline, but when
 we correctly cluster at catchment area level, the effect is just not significan
t (p-value = 0.14).
 However, these findings should be interpreted with care as we are likely
 to be under-powered to estimate interaction effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the hypothesis that trainings are less effective if dealers
 do not have incentives to learn, social desirability bias could be another
 explanation why we do not find stronger effects of the training on knowledge,
 as all variables which constitute the knowledge indices are self-reported.
 If dealers strategically do something incorrectly, they might report that
 they do not know how to do it, as being uninformed is more socially desirable
 than making mistakes intentionally.
 For example, if dealers often repack seed even though they know that they
 should not, and the enumerator is aware of that because repacked seed is
 laying on the counter for sale, they may report that they agree most with
 the statement 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You should repackage all your seed to visually verify that you are selling
 good quality seed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You should avoid repackaging your seed as much as possible.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 However, we do not expect this to be a problem for the second Index of
 dealer knowledge about seed, as it mainly includes questions related to
 which maize varieties dealers would recommend under specific circumstances
 and what they tell clients about the yield benefits of hybrid seeds.
 We do not see why dealers would answer these questions incorrectly if they
 know the correct answer, as neither enumerators nor anyone else would notice
 if there is a difference between the answer they provide to us and the
 information they give clients, e.g., about the yield benefits of hybrid seeds.
 As we do not have any measures of knowledge that are not self-reported,
 we cannot provide an analysis that is robust to social desirability bias.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Dealer efforts, services, and practices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The information clearinghouse provides agro-input dealers with an incentive
 to become better than their direct competitors.
 To do so, they may increase effort and start providing more or better services
 to get higher ratings, hoping that they will retain or even increase their
 number of customers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Effects on dealer efforts"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we provide evidence that agro-input dealers that are exposed to the clearingho
use indeed invest more effort than dealers in the control group.
 The table shows results for one overall index and four individual indices
 that each capture different dimensions of efforts, services, and practices.
 A first index focuses on effort and service provision as reported by agro-input
 dealers themselves.
 It is composed of seven different variables: whether dealers offer explanations
 on how to use improved seed, recommend complementary inputs to get optimal
 results from improved varieties, provide extension or training, offer discounts
 for larger quantities, offer credit, received a seed related customer complaint
 since last season, and accept mobile money.
 A second index summarizes the perceptions of farmers that are customers
 at these agro-input dealers.
 This index is also constructed from seven variables: whether a shop offers
 refunds or insurance, provides credit, offers training or advice to customers,
 delivers to the farm-gate, provides after-sales service, accepts different
 payment methods, and sells small quantities.
 The answers of farmers are aggregated at the dealer level before the index
 is computed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To handle and store seed correctly, a combination of investments and labor-inten
sive practices is necessary.
 Also during the agro-input dealer training, we recommended a mix of practices
 that are in reach of different types of dealers, some of which may have
 excess labor while others may have access to money to invest.
 A third index groups a set of labor-intensive seed handling and storage
 practices.
 It contains six variables: whether seed is stored in a dedicated area,
 in correct lighting, on appropriate surface, and not in open containers,
 whether the shop has no pest problem, and a cleanness and professionality
 rating provided by the enumerator.
 All of these variables were collected or at least confirmed by enumerators
 through visual inspection, none of them is self-reported.
 A fourth index summarizes some capital-intensive practices, including these
 six variables: whether the roof is leak-proof, and insulated, whether the
 walls are insulated, whether the shop is ventilated, displays any official
 certificate, and whether expired seed is handled correctly.
 Most of these variables were collected or at least confirmed by enumerators
 through visual inspection, only one of them (whether expired seed is handled
 correctly) is self-reported.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To check whether social desirability affects this result, we exclude the
 variable from the index and rerun the analysis, as dealers might report
 that they handle expired seed correctly but strategically not do so, e.g.,
 to cut costs.
 Doing this does not change the coefficients for the Index of capital-intensive
 seed handling practices in any notable way.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that the clearinghouse intervention increases dealer efforts and
 services, especially at midline, where the coefficient of the overall index
 is significant at the 1% level.
 This effect is driven by treated agro-input dealers who significantly raised
 their efforts and services, according to farmers.
 We see that impact persists until endline, where the significant effect
 on the overall index seems to be driven by the self-reported measure of
 effort.
 We do not find that the agro-input dealer training improved services or
 practices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, we asked enumerators if they saw the SeedAdvisor certificate
 in the shop at endline.
 The answer to this question does not contribute to any of the outcome indices
 because it only showed up in interviews with clearinghouse treated dealers.
 For this subgroup, 55% of enumerators reported that they saw it.

\begin_layout Standard
As it is difficult to assess seed quality via visual inspection, agro-input
 dealers may use various strategies to signal to customers that their products
 are of good quality.
 Becoming a member of professional organizations is one way to do so, as
 these memberships signal professionalism.
 Dealers who try to signal quality will also not shy away from inspections.
 On the contrary, they may actively seek inspection so that they can advertise
 the result in their shops.
 Alternatively, the SeedAdvisor certificates could attract inspectors if
 they increase the visibility of the shop.

 collects a set of variables related to signaling quality, including memberships
 in UNADA and other professional associations, trading licenses, the number
 of inspections in the last season, and warnings or confiscations of seed
 after inspection.
 We find that at endline, judged by the overall index, the clearinghouse
 treatment led to a significant increase in quality assurance measures.
 Looking at the individual outcomes, the overall effect seems to be driven
 by an increase in registrations with UNADA.
 We also see that shops were inspected significantly more often.

Switching
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important potential mechanism underlying the effect of the information
 clearinghouse is the possibility that farmers switch from lower rated agro-inpu
t dealers to shops that have better ratings.
 To explore this impact pathway, we asked farmers if they switched agro-input
 dealers since the previous season and report the results in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "switchingfarmers"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 We see that only 17% of farmers reported switching at baseline.
 However, at midline, a significantly higher share of farmers in the clearinghou
se treatment group reported switching dealers.
 Also at endline, we find a higher propensity to switch dealers among clearingho
use treated farmers.

\begin_layout Standard
The above reveals increased mobility in the treatment group, but it does
 not establish that farmers move from lower rated agro-input dealers to
 higher rated ones.
 To further investigate this, we calculate the difference between the rating
 of shop the farmer is switching to and the rating of the shop the farmer
 is switching from.
 If farmers move to better rated shops, this difference would be positive.
 We find that this is indeed the case, and more so during the second season,
 but the difference is not significantly different from zero at conventional
 levels (p-value = 0.166).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also explore switching from the agro-input dealer perspective.
 Here we look at the relationship between the rating a shop received and
 its number of customers (standardized within the catchment area).
 If farmers switch from poorly rated dealers to better rated ones, we would
 expect to see a positive correlation in areas where the clearinghouse treatment
 was implemented.
 Figure

 shows that shops with higher ratings at midline receive more customers
 at endline.
 However, this evidence is not very strong and at most suggestive.

Perceptions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the information clearinghouse may change farmer perceptions of
 the quality of seed sold by agro-input dealers.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Effects of clearinghouse on farmer perceptions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 provides an analysis of this impact pathway.
 As a first measure of their perceptions, we asked farmers if they think
 that maize seed that they can buy at agro-input shops is counterfeit or
 adulterated.
 At baseline, two in three farmers responded affirmative to this question.
 Columns (2) to (5) show the impact of the clearinghouse for the full sample.
 The treatment does not significantly affect farmer perceptions as measured
 by this variable at mid- or endline.
 However, we expect the effect of the clearinghouse on perceptions to be
 strongest for farmers who did not adopt improved maize varieties at baseline.
 Therefore, we repeat the analysis for this subgroup of farmers in columns
 (6) to (9).
 At midline, farmers that did not adopt at baseline and live in areas exposed
 to the clearinghouse are 12.5 percentage points less likely to think that
 agro-input dealers sell adulterated seed than similar farmers in areas
 not assigned to the treatment.
 The effect disappears at endline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another important outcome is related to farmer perceptions of product quality:
 the index of maize seed ratings contains the general quality, yield, drought
 tolerance, pest and disease tolerance, time of maturity, and germination
 rating.
 These ratings are aggregated at the farmer level (as one farmer rates multiple
 shops), then the index is calculated.
 To compute this index at smallholder level, a farmer needs to have rated
 at least one dealer in the catchment area on all components of the index,
 which leads to a sample size reduction, which in turn may affect statistical
 power.
 Nonetheless, we see that the index is positively and significantly affected
 by the clearinghouse treatment, even though the effect is only significant
 at the 10% level.
 If we restrict the sample to farmers that did not adopt improved maize
 varieties at baseline, the treatment effect on the ratings is significant
 at the 5% level.
 Also the impact on the overall combining index is significant for this
 sub-sample.

$^1$The index of farmer's maize seed ratings contains 6 ratings: general
 quality, yield, drought tolerance, pest/disease tolerance, time of maturity,
 germination.
 The ratings are aggregated at farmer level (one farmer rates multiple shops),
 then the index is computed.
 Note that treatment and control groups can only be compared at endline.
 At base- and midline, only clearinghouse treated farmers rated dealers
 in their proximity because being confronted with these questions is part
 of the treatment.
 Hence control dealers were not rated and this line is left blank at midline.
 At endline, all farmers rated all shops, so that this variable can be investiga
ted.

\begin_layout Standard
It would be straightforward to assume that treated farmers perceive seed
 to be better because the clearinghouse improved seed quality.
 Unfortunately, we cannot verify this because objectively measuring seed
 quality is challenging (see Footnote 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "footnote quality"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 That is why we cannot confidently conclude that farmers' perceptions of
 seed improve because treated dealers improve seed quality by handling seed
 better.
 Instead, there could be other variables at play, farmers could e.g., rate
 seed at treated dealers better because these dealers decide to provide
 advice and recommendations in response to the clearinghouse, which is surely
 useful but has no impact on the actual quality of maize seed.
 Even though we cannot conclude that the clearinghouse improved objective
 maize seed quality, it did so in the eyes of smallholder farmers, which
 is what counts after all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively, the clearinghouse may have mainly improved perceptions, and
 there are also arguments in favor of this hypothesis.
 We demonstrate that the intervention affects several measures of adoption
 already at midline.
 If we assume that changing dealer behavior and farmers noticing this change
 takes some time, rectifying incorrect perceptions of smallholders must
 have played an important role in increasing their adoption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also note that the average agro-input shop was rated 3.4 out of 5 at baseline
 which indicates that seed quality was not so poor to begin with.
 One could argue that this statement contradicts the one above stating that
 two in three farmers thought that maize seed at agro-input shops is counterfeit
 or adulterated at baseline.
 However, we do not necessarily agree: when farmers are asked about seed
 quality at agro-input shops 
\shape italic
in general
\shape default
, their perceptions are negative, but when they rate seed 
\shape italic
at a particular shop
\shape default
, they are not.
 This indicates that smallholders' general opinions about the market are
 pessimistic but when they focus on their own or someone else's individual
 experiences, they realize that they are not too dissatisfied after all.
 Hence the two statements do not necessarily contradict each other, they
 are answers to differently asked questions.
 This illustrates that farmers' perceptions of the quality of the inputs
 in the market are not robust and that misperceptions are quite likely.
 Furthermore, note that the entire farmer sample provided answers to the
 counterfeiting/adulteration question, whereas only farmers who bought seed
 at a particular shop or know someone who did were able to provide ratings,
 so that the share of adopters is likely to be larger among farmers who
 rated at baseline then in the full sample.
 This could indicate that farmers who do not adopt have worse perceptions
 of seed quality than farmers who do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We interpret this as support for the hypothesis that the quality of maize
 seed at some shops in our sample is sufficient but non-adopting farmers
 misperceive it.
 This is in line with

 who establish that input quality is good but that farmers’ beliefs are
 often incorrect, so that one simply needs to rectify this misperception
 to increase adoption.
 The information clearinghouse provides an innovative way to do so.

 reports attrition levels in the treatment and comparison groups.
 We failed to collect data from 12% of dealers and 2% of farmers at midline,
 and from 14% of dealers and 1% of farmers at endline.
 To test if non-response is related to one of the treatments, we regress
 the likelihood of leaving the sample on the treatment indicators.
 We find that clearinghouse treated dealers are significantly less likely
 to leave the sample.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whether our estimates are biased or not depends on whether this attrition
 is random or not.
 It is for instance plausible that the worst performing shops in the clearinghou
se control group went out of business.
 Our clearinghouse treatment might have prevented bankruptcy and helped
 dealers to stay in the market because it served as some kind of advertisement
 if the rating was good.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, it is plausible that enumerators invested less effort
 when searching control dealers because they did not have to deliver their
 SeedAdvisor certificates.
 Carrying this certificate might have made them more persistent when looking
 for a shop because they did not want to return to their supervisor without
 having delivered that paper.
 Moreover, the certificate might have helped enumerators to find the treated
 dealers because they were able to show the names to neighbors etc.
 (instead of just asking) who in turn helped finding them.
 In that case, a larger number of random dealers left the control sample,
 meaning that the dealers who were not found are not different from the
 ones that were found.
 The sub-sample of dealers that remained in the control group would then
 be representative for the entire control group, hence our estimates would
 be unbiased.
 Attrition would only reduce power.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We noticed the attrition problem after midline data collection and instructed
 our enumerators to be more thorough at endline.
 Consequently, 7 of 28 clearinghouse control dealers who were not found
 for the midline interview, were found for the endline interview later that
 year.
 This supports our claim that at least a share control dealer attrition
 can be explained by a lack of enumerator effort instead of bankruptcy.
 Furthermore, even if attrition is non-random, the bias is likely to be
 negative and treatment effects are expected to be positive.
 As such, the unadjusted selection-contaminated estimates provide

note for Robert & David:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In previous versions of the paper, I included a heterogeneity analysis for
 more competitive areas (i.e., areas with more than 1 dealer, or areas with
 more than 2 dealers), as one could argue that the information clearinghouse
 will not work in areas with little competition, as farmers have less opportunit
ies to switch to better dealers and dealers would have less incentives to
 improve their services and increase their efforts if there is no threat
 of competition nearby.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In our sample, 46 of 130 catchment areas are served by only one dealer,
 40 areas are served by only two dealers.
 The effects on this subset of dealers are generally similar or slightly
 weaker.
 I decided to not include any of the heterogeneity analyses for two reasons.
 Firstly, impact through competition is only one pathway, and after all
 the analyses I have done, I am convinced that it is not the most important
 one.
 Secondly, I do not trust these results because a) the analysis was not
 pre-registered and b) we are likely to be under-powered for this estimation:
 the coefficients may have changed due to the smaller sample size, not due
 to heterogeneous effects in this subset of catchment areas.
 If you're interested in the results anyway, let me know.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though agricultural technologies like high yielding seed varieties
 and inorganic fertilizers are considered to be key in increasing agricultural
 productivity and accelerating rural transformation, the adoption by smallholder
s remains persistently low in sub-Saharan Africa.
 We study one particular constraint to technology adoption: the perceived
 quality of agricultural inputs.
 We hypothesize that seed quality deteriorates because agro-input dealers
 lack knowledge and/or because asymmetric information results in excessive
 search costs for farmers and reduced incentives for dealers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To assess the importance of these potential constraints to agricultural
 technology adoption, we tested two interventions in the market for improved
 maize seed varieties in eastern Uganda using an RCT.
 A training informed agro-input dealers about correct seed handling and
 storage practices.
 An information clearinghouse based on crowd-sourced ratings of the seed
 that agro-input dealers sell was expected to reduce the information asymmetry
 between seller and buyer by making the quality of maize seed observable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results of our analyses show that training agro-input dealers does not
 change their practices, and consequently, their operations remain unaffected.
 We also do not find any impact on farmers that live in the catchment areas
 of dealers that were trained: they do not perceive seed quality differently
 nor have higher adoption rates than farmers that were not exposed to trained
 dealers.
 These null results show that investing in trainings only may not be an
 effective strategy as long as dealers are not incentivized.
 In fact, our results suggest that if agro-input dealers have the right
 incentives, they actively seek out knowledge necessary to improve and keep
 ahead of competitors.
 If dealers are exposed to both, incentives and information, they handle
 and store seed better and attract more business.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The information clearinghouse clearly affected the Ugandan market for maize
 seed as sellers and buyers started behaving in line with our theory of
 change.
 Agro-input dealers report more business and smallholders report increased
 use of improved maize varieties.
 This effect seems to partly originate from dealers who increase effort
 and expand service provision to outperform their competition.
 There is also evidence that the clearinghouse improves the opinions that
 farmers hold about agro-input shops and their products.
 In areas where the clearinghouse was implemented, farmers are also more
 likely to switch between agro-input dealers, but our evidence that they
 move from lower rated dealers to higher rated ones is at most suggestive.
 However, as clearinghouse treated farmers report higher yields than control
 farmers, we can safely conclude that this intervention affected smallholders
 positively, which is important in terms of welfare implications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We conclude that quality considerations are important constraints to the
 adoption of agricultural inputs.
 This has notable implications for the public sector.
 Ideally, it needs to safeguard seed supply chains to prevent mishandling
 and secure the delivery of high quality inputs to farmers.
 One way to do so would be controls and checks along the supply chain, including
 inspections of agro-input shops.
 A complementary strategy would be to inform farmers how to examine bags
 of seed and identify characteristics that indicate mishandling, such as
 expired dates, or even tampering or fraud, such as torn seals and seams,
 and scratched e-verification labels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also see important implications for the private sector.
 If seed companies want to successfully market their products, they need
 to acknowledge that many of their potential customers have concerns about
 quality.
 Their current efforts to make products identifiable and traceable have
 not been very effective: we bought seed bags from dealers in our sample,
 and only 8% of them have a certification sticker, and only 3% show an electroni
c verification label.
 To assure farmers that they are buying authentic, high-quality seed, companies
 need stronger signals of product quality.
 Some of them started labeling their bags with information about germination
 testing, and in Kenya, some companies started marketing their seed using
 novel packaging features to signal product authenticity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Any strategy to reduce information asymmetries between sellers and buyers
 by making input quality more observable is likely to benefit the market
 for quality inputs.
 These are clear opportunities for innovations in the private sector that
 could build consumer confidence in the quality of the improved maize seed
 available at agro-input dealers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A crowd-sourced information clearinghouse can be an important institutional
 innovation to solve the problem of asymmetric information in the market
 for agricultural inputs.
 It may be preferable to alternative strategies due to its likely lower
 cost and self-sustaining nature, and helps to overcome problems such as
 insufficient public investment in regulatory systems, regulatory enforcement,
 and market surveillance.
 Furthermore, peers, who are familiar with the heterogeneous conditions
 farmers face, provide the clearinghouse ratings, and their opinion may
 be more useful and trustworthy for smallholders than the judgment of an
 inspector or a seed certification or verification system.
\begin_inset Note Note
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
I'm not sure whether we want to promote the clearinghouse as the solution,
 saying that people should find cost-effective ways to scale this up and
 put this into practice.
 Or if it's just a proof of concept, showing that quality considerations
 are important constraints, implying other solutions from the public & private
 sector.
 Depending on that, we should restructure the conclusion accordingly.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objective of this paper is to prove a concept and to test whether a
 prediction of the theory occurs in practice, namely whether making quality
 observable improves the market for maize seed.
 If the clearinghouse would be scaled up, several challenges would need
 to be addressed.
 For example, one should decide how long SeedAdvisor certificates remain
 valid and whether they have to be removed at some point, as old certificates
 could provide incorrect signals, and dealers who received a good certificate
 at some point in time would not have any incentive to keep up the good
 work if the outdated certificate remains displayed in their store.
 Furthermore, farmers may favor dealers they personally know well or discriminat
e against minorities, and these preferences, instead of quality differences,
 may be reflected in the ratings.
 In this case, the ratings would need to be monitored and potentially adjusted,
 to avoid that the clearinghouse amplifies bias or discrimination.
 Another danger to the functioning of the clearinghouse could be agro-input
 dealers who start to influence ratings in a dishonest manner, e.g., by faking
 ratings or by bribing farmers.
 Note that during this trial, rating and rated participants were connected
 by asking dealers where their customers come from, and collecting ratings
 from ten randomly selected farmers in that village.
 Dealers would need to understand our experimental design in order to know
 which farmer they would need to influence, so that it is almost impossible
 that they cheat during this trial, but details like this need to be considered
 before scaling up the experiment.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objective of the clearinghouse is to make maize seed quality observable,
 so that its functioning would be endangered if farmers' ratings do not
 actually measure quality but e.g., the personal relationship between a farmer
 and a dealer.
 Some could even argue that farmers cannot assess the quality of maize seed
 at all, even not after using it, because there are so many factors at play
 in agricultural production: if farmers experience a disappointing harvest,
 they cannot safely conclude that the seed material was poor because it
 could have also been poor soil, insufficient, late or too much rain, or
 own mismanagement like late planting or insufficient weeding.
 Misattribution occurs when farmers mistakenly ascribe bad outcomes to bad
 inputs, rather than to other possible causes.
 Learning about the true quality becomes more difficult when this misattribution
 is present (Hoel et al., 2021).
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "tjernstrom2021learning"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 agree that sub-Saharan Africa's soil heterogeneity hampers farmer learning
 about the returns to inputs.
 Maize seed would then be a credence good instead of an experience good
 and clearinghouse ratings of farmers would be useless.
 Even though farmers and dealers might still change their behavior in the
 short run because they expect the clearinghouse to work, this effect would
 fade out as soon as both actors learn that the ratings are unreliable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We argue that farmers’ ability to infer maize seed quality is indeed not
 perfect but they can assess it to some extent.
 Shortly after planting, farmers can observe germination rates, i.e.
 the proportion of seeds that germinate, and later how fast the seed matures.
 Some seed may also be more susceptible to pests and diseases, while other
 seed may be particularly tolerant in terms of drought.
 After harvest, the farmer can observe the yield.
 All these attributes of seed quality can be judged to some extent after
 one agricultural season.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To support our claim, we test if the ratings are correlated with objective
 indications of seed quality.
 We find that specialized agro-input shops which only sell farm inputs have
 higher ratings, so do dealers with better seed handling practices.
 Furthermore, farmers did not only rate the seed of agro-input shops but
 also the seed they used on a randomly selected maize field, using the same
 questions.
 We find that these seed ratings are positively correlated with farmers'
 yield.
 All this shows that the clearinghouse ratings do measure maize seed quality
 to some extent.

I suggest to delete this paragraph because it proves nothing: specialized
 shops are rated better, but much more than seed quality could explain this,
 e.g., specialized shops have more capital on average and "fancier shops"
 and farmers rate fancy looking shops better.
 And of course farmers with high yields rate their seed better, also if
 that high yield can be attributed to good management or perfect rainfall
 instead of seed quality.

\begin_layout Paragraph*
What to do if a treated dealer does not receive a single rating?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a shop in a treated catchment area is not rated by a single farmer, e.g.,
 because no farmer in our sample knows him or her, we could fill in the
 catchment area mean as his or her rating.
 However, this is not as innocent as it seems because it is likely that
 the lack of ratings is not random.
 Poor quality dealers have less customers, so their likelihood to get rated
 is lower.
 Giving them average catchment area ratings inflates the ratings of these
 low quality dealers.
 Instead, we simply told farmers that we do not have information about this
 shop (implicitly informing the farmer that it exists).
 16 of 193 treated dealers were not rated by a single farmer in the first
 round.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Should more ratings lead to better ratings?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some shops were not rated by any smallholder in the first round, while others
 were rated by up to 22 smallholders.
 If dealer A is rated by 10 farmers and gets rating 3,5 and dealer B is
 rated by 1 farmer and gets rating 3,6, we treat dealer B as the better
 dealer.
 Even though receiving many (few) ratings can be related to good (poor)
 quality (the lack of ratings could be nonrandom, see previous paragraph),
 there could be other reasons why dealers are rated by many (few) farmers.
 Furthermore, giving higher ratings to better-known dealers could harm new
 dealers entering the market and dealers who are discriminated, e.g., due
 to their gender.
 Also on TripAdvisor, having more reviews than a rival hotel does not lead
 to a better rating.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Should ratings depend on catchment area dealer performance?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following examples show that ratings should not depend on catchment
 area averages.
 In an area with poor quality dealers in which one dealer is a bit better
 than the rest but still poor, we do not want this dealer to be rated well
 (i.e., expose farmers to poor quality dealers).
 Similarly, in an area with good dealers in which one dealer is a bit worse
 than the rest but still good, we do not want this dealer to be rated poorly
 (which would be unfair towards him or her).
 On the other hand, less than 9% of shops received a rating below 3 out
 of 5, so we would throw away valuable data if we would only disseminate
 good scores without any variation.
 Therefore, we take the distribution of ratings into account by using quintiles.
 Consequently, less dealers receive rating 4 or 5, more dealers receive
 rating 1 or 2.
 This could strengthen the effect of the treatment on dealer effort.
 If dealers get ratings 1 or 2 instead of 4 or 5, they could feel more inclined
 to improve their scores.
 Consequently, also the effect on seed quality itself could be larger.
 However, the clearinghouse should also have a signaling effect, which might
 be weaker if more dealers are rated 1 or 2 instead of 4 or 5 (dealers would
 seem to be of worse quality to farmers).
 Therefore, we chose words with a positive connotation as the quintile names
 for rating dissemination.
 As most dealers received a good or very good rating before taking the distribut
ion into account, we ensure that even a 2 is still communicated as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

good
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to farmers to not weaken the signaling effect.
 That is why the first quintile is translated to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

okay
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and gets one star, the second one is named 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

good
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and receives two stars, the third quintile is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

very good
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and gets three stars, the fourth and fifth one are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

excellent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and awarded with four and five stars.
 This way of considering the distribution of the original ratings when choosing
 the names also helps us to disseminate ratings as truthfully, purely and
 as closely to reality as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Are female dealers rated worse than male dealers?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because we found significant differences between the ratings of female (41%
 of dealers) and male agro-input dealers (59% of dealers) after controlling
 for some potentially confounding variables like education and for several
 indications of quality, we have no reason to believe that these differences
 in perception can be explained by differences in real quality.
 Instead, it is likely that women are perceived to be worse due to discriminatio
n 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "De2022"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, so that we adjusted the ratings of female dealers accordingly to prevent
 that they are harmed by our intervention.
 We regressed all seed quality attributes on the gender dummy and added
 the resulting coefficients to the initial ratings of female dealers.
