Quality constraints to agricultural technology adoption: Can an information
 clearinghouse save the Ugandan market for seed?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Agricultural technologies remain under-adopted among smallholder farmers
 in sub-Saharan Africa.
 We investigate how the quality of an agricultural input affects its adoption.
 As the sellers of maize seed have more information about its quality than
 the buyers, we hypothesize that this information asymmetry leads to poor
 seed quality offered by some agro-input dealers, resulting in under-adoption
 by farmers.
 To overcome this classic lemons technology problem which hurts seed buyers
 and sellers, we implement a crowd-sourced information clearinghouse similar
 to yelp.com in the market for seed, meaning that we collect and disseminate
 farmers' ratings of seed quality.
 This intervention is tested in a randomized controlled trial among 350
 agro-input dealers and 3500 smallholder maize farmers in Uganda.
 Midline data shows that dealers increase their efforts and improve their
 services in response to the clearinghouse.
 Treated farmers are also more likely to switch from one to another shop.
 There are some indications that these two mechanisms eventually lead to
 better maize seed quality but endline data has yet to be analyzed.

\begin_layout Standard
Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa do not sufficiently adopt agricultural
 technologies like high yielding seed varieties and fertilizers, even though
 these inputs are seen as the key to agricultural productivity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 As a result, differences in agricultural yields between sub-Saharan Africa
 and countries in Latin America and Asia have almost doubled since 1961

 Experts argue that the substantial growth in yields in these countries
 can largely be explained by increased technology adoption whereas the stagnatio
n of yields in sub-Saharan Africa can mostly be explained low adoption 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 At the individual level, farmers who do not adopt miss out on increased
 yields and farm profits 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, and potentially on a way out of poverty and a better life.
 Also at the aggregate level, the lag in adoption has high costs in terms
 of economic development and human welfare and is holding back the reduction
 of rural food insecurity and poverty.
 That is why it is important to identify the drivers of and constraints
 to agricultural technology adoption.
\end_layout

 One issue is poor information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This study addresses a particular constraint to technology adoption: the
 perceived quality of agricultural inputs in the market, which has received
 considerable attention from academics and policy makers recently

Because agricultural input quality is difficult to observe, information
 asymmetries between sellers and buyers characterize the markets for seed
 and fertilizer.

.
 In such a market where sellers have more information about the quality
 of the good than buyers, there is no incentive for vendors to sell good
 products and average quality can degrade.
 Note that both, buyers and sellers, suffer from the resulting poor average
 quality in the market.
 In line with this economic theory, recent studies claim that smallholder
 adoption of agricultural inputs, and of improved maize seed in Uganda in
 particular, is limited by farmers’ beliefs that the inputs are of poor
 quality - counterfeited, adulterated, or otherwise not performing

.
 These studies provide empirical evidence of Ugandan agricultural inputs
 being lemons...
 others show that *perceived* to be lemons (so they aren't of low quality,
 only farmer beliefs).
 In line with this literature, we hypothesize that the intentional and unintenti
onal malpractices of dealers lead to poor seed quality, resulting in under-adopt
ion by smallholder farmers.
 These quality issues might therefore constrain the emergence and sustainability
 of an efficient seed system.

To this end, we look at Ugandan

 Maize is an important crop in Uganda, both for home consumption and as

In line with the general trend in economics, these drivers and constraints
 have increasingly been studied using field experiments

 For instance, the Agricultural Technology Adoption Initiative (ATAI), a
 collaboration between MIT's Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL)
 and UC Berkeley's Center for Effective Global Action (CEGA), has funded
 a series of field experiments to illuminate what helps and hinders adoption
 among smallholder farmers.
 The literature has identified several key constraints which include poor
 access to information

\begin_layout Standard
To assess the importance of this potential constraint to agricultural technology
 adoption, we test an intervention which reduces the information asymmetry
 between seller and buyer by making the quality of maize seed observable.
 We implement a decentralized information clearinghouse that is based on
 crowd-sourced ratings and works through reputational mechanisms, much like
 yelp.com or tripadvisor.com.
 Introducing a clearinghouse in the Ugandan market for seed means that we
 aggregate the experiences of many users under similar conditions (similar
 location, weather, soil, etc.) to reveal the quality of maize seed sold
 by each agro-input dealer.
 The treatment targets the interaction between farmers and dealers who sell
 improved seed and play a crucial role because they form a key link between
 seed producers and users.
 This crowd-sourced information clearinghouse is tested in a randomized
 controlled trial (RCT) among 350 agro-input dealers and 3500 smallholder
 maize farmers in Uganda.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Midline data shows that dealers increase their efforts and improve their
 services in response to the clearinghouse.
 Treated farmers are also more likely to switch from one to another shop.
 There are some indications that these two mechanisms eventually lead to
 better maize seed quality.
 Heterogeneity analysis suggests that the clearinghouse works better for
 dealers who specialize and for dealers who face more competition.
 However, endline data has to be analyzed before we can confidently draw
 conclusions.

Agro-input dealers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The clearinghouse targets the interaction between the farmer and the agro-input
 dealer.
 Agro-input shops are businesses that sell inputs and equipment used in
 agricultural production, such as improved seed
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Agro-input shops sell only 
\shape italic
improved
\shape default
 seed.
 The alternative to improved seed is farmer saved seed which farmers harvest
 themselves in one crop season and save to plant it in the following season.
 This seed is usually free of charge (if the farmer him/herself saves it)
 or cheap (if a neighbor, relative, someone else saves it) and not sold
 by agro-input shops.
\end_layout

\end_inset

, fertilizers, and other agricultural technologies.
 These dealers play an important role in the seed system because they create
 a market for agricultural technologies, develop and disseminate knowledge,
 and sometimes perform additional tasks like providing farm credit 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "hornum2021functional"

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, they are part of an important network with connections to
 actors across the value chain, such as manufacturers of inputs (e.g.
 seed companies), government organizations (e.g.
 breeders) and other agribusinesses.
 While the importance of the dealers in the seed supply chain seems straightforw
ard and some authors emphasize the role of private agents 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "de2016agricultural"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, there are very few studies which target these actors.
 As the shops form a key link between the producers and users of agricultural
 technologies, the activities of these dealers play an important role and
 quality issues may arise at their level.
 That is why our clearinghouse specifically targets agro-input shops and
 dealers.

The problem
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsection: The problem"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ability of smallholder farmers to assess the quality of maize seed before
 purchase is severely limited, as they can only visually examine seed purity
 and the presence of mold.
 That is why we hypothesize that some agro-input dealers exploit this informatio
n asymmetry, and that their malpractices lead to poor seed quality.
 Note that both players, buyers and sellers, suffer from the resulting poor
 average quality in this lemon market.
 In a context relatively similar to ours, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hoffmann2021observability"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 look at maize grain as an output in rural Kenya and find that there is
 no incentive for sellers to address food safety losses because they are
 not observable for buyers, so that there is no correlation between prices
 and this unobservable quality attribute.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These malpractices may be 
\shape italic
intentional
\shape default
.
 Agro-input dealers may sacrifice quality to increase profits, e.g.
 by mixing improved and new seed with not improved seed or old seed, to
 cut costs.
 Mind that these dealers operate in markets with weak, under-resourced instituti
ons and regulatory systems.
 There is empirical evidence of this kind of adulteration at some point
 in the Ugandan agricultural input supply chain.

 find that the average bottle of herbicide is missing 15% of the active
 ingredient and nearly one in three bottles contains less than 75% of the

 Both studies were conducted in Uganda.
 Recently the topic has also received considerable attention from local
 news channels 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

 and policy makers.
 A National Seed Policy report written by the Ugandan Ministry of Agriculture,
 Animal Industry and Fisheries states that 30-40% of seed traded in the
 market is counterfeit 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyearpar
key "NationalSeedPolicy"

\end_inset

.
 Also in our sample, 68% of farmers think that maize seed that is sold at
 shops is adulterated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, these malpractices may be 
\shape italic
unintentional
\shape default
.
 Poor seed handling and storage may lead to deterioration in quality.
 The agro-input dealer may thus sell seed of inferior quality without intending
 to do so.
 There is also some evidence of this kind of quality reduction.
 In a comprehensive study of the Ugandan seed supply chain, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "BARRIGA2020104928"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 document various issues related to handling and storage that may reduce
 the quality of this input.
 For instance, smallholder farmers often need smaller quantities than what
 is packaged in standard bags, and dealers thus often repackage in sub-optimal
 environments.
 Poor rotation of seed stock and storage in open bags, in moist conditions
 or in direct sunlight also reduce seed quality.
 
\begin_inset Note Note

Also in our baseline data, we find a positive correlation between a seed
 bag's shelf-life and its moisture, meaning that older seed is more moist,
 and therefore more susceptible to storage molds and pests." - I included
 this sentence due to your comment but am not sure whether it fits here.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In a way, lack of care is also intentional because one can invest in facilities
 if it is worthwile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These intentional and unintentional malpractices at the dealer level may
 lead to poor agricultural input quality.
 Purchasing poor inputs will lead to disappointing experiences at the farmer
 level.
 This will reduce their willingness to pay.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "gharib2021fear"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 find that concerns about seed quality reduce farmers’ willingness to invest
 in seeds, as farmers are willing to pay 15% more for bags directly from
 the seed company than for bags from local retailers.
 That is why we hypothesize that smallholder farmers' seed adoption is low
 because they perceive the quality of these inputs sold at agro-input dealers
 to be poor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
A potential solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This classic lemons technology problem which hurts seed buyers and sellers
 can be solved by reducing information asymmetries between the two parties.
 In Kenya, seed companies have started marketing their seed using novel
 packaging features to signal product quality and authenticity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gharib2021fear"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Uganda does regulate seed quality by means of certifications and standards,
 but they provide farmers with a relatively weak and unreliable indication
 of quality.
 We bought seed bags from agro-input dealers in our sample, and only 8%
 of them have a certification sticker from an inspection agency.
 Alternatives such as electronic verification systems have also been experimente
d with, but the cost of implementation has proven challenging, and they
 depend on the reliability of the underlying seed certification system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That is why we test an alternative, decentralized clearinghouse that is
 based on crowd-sourced information and works through reputational mechanisms,
 much like yelp.com or tripadvisor.com.
 This implies that we ask smallholder farmers to rate dealers in their proximity
 on a number of seed quality characteristics.
 Then we disseminate these average dealer ratings back to farmers and dealers.
 We inform farmers about the ratings when we visit them again, and by sending
 them text messages.
 Dealers are informed about their ratings by means of certificates which
 we deliver to their shops.
 Studies in other contexts have shown that new crowd-based sources of pre-purcha
se information can be particularly useful.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "reimers2021digitization"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 compare the impacts of professional critics and Amazon star ratings of
 books on consumer welfare.
 The aggregate effect of star ratings on consumer surplus is more than ten
 times the effect of traditional review outlets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Information clearinghouse mechanisms in developing countries have been studied
 to some extent, but mostly to address market price information asymmetries
 between smallholder farmers and middlemen.
 Assuming that middlemen are better informed about prevailing prices in
 the market than farmers, theory suggests that providing farmers with price
 information improves the functioning of rural agricultural markets.
 However, evidence is mixed: while 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "10.2307/25760218"

\end_inset

 finds that internet kiosks that provide wholesale price information significant
ly increase soy prices in India, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "fafchamps2012impact"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 do not find a statistically significant effect of market information delivered
 to farmers' mobile phones in a neighboring state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A clearinghouse that relies on crowd-sourced ratings may be more effective
 in increasing seed quality in the market.
 While prices can generally be observed quite easily, assessing an experience
 good such as seed is much more difficult.
 Aggregating the experiences of many users may thus be a particularly powerful
 way to reveal the quality of the product.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A study by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hasanain2019no"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, who set up an innovative rating system for public veterinary services
 in Pakistan, is probably the closest to ours.
 They find that farmers who use the clearinghouse enjoy a 25% higher success
 rate of artificial insemination.
 Their research suggests that this is mostly due to increased veterinarian
 effort, as few farmers seem to be switching from veterinaries that receive
 poor ratings to veterinaries that receive good ratings.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeauthor
key "hasanain2019no"
literal "true"

\end_inset

's study, veterinaries provide their services directly, without an intermediary.
 If producers do not sell to customers directly, so that more entities and
 transactions are involved, there is even more scope for information asymmetries.
 That is why reducing asymmetric information can be even more important
 in markets with intermediaries like agro-input dealers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hence a crowd-sourced information clearinghouse can be an important institutiona
l innovation to solve the problem of asymmetric information in the market
 for agricultural inputs and may affect both intentional and non-intentional
 quality reductions by reducing malpractices at the agro-input dealer level.
 We hypothesize that it improves smallholder farmers' perception and adoption
 of agricultural inputs.
 It may be preferable to alternative strategies due to its likely lower
 cost, self-sustaining nature and scaleability, and helps to overcome problems
 such as insufficient public investment in regulatory systems, regulatory
 enforcement, and market surveillance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An information clearinghouse could work through different impact pathways
 which are illustrated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Firstly, farmers who did not buy (or who bought only a little) seed before
 may start adopting (or start adopting more) improved seed when they realize
 that an agro-input dealer in their vicinity has a good rating, meaning
 that the quality of the seed sold there is better than expected.
 The literature indicates that this pathway of improving the perception
 of quality without actually improving quality could be very relevant.

 establish that the nutrient content of fertilizer in Tanzania is good and
 meets industry standards but that farmers believe that it is adulterated.
 One would simply need to correct farmers’ beliefs which are inconsistent
 with the reality to increase adoption.
 Also 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "wossen2022misperceiving"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 show that farmers in developing countries routinely misperceive input quality
 and that rectifying this misperception may improve farmers’ investment
 choices and productivity outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Secondly, farmers could switch from low rated shops to higher rated shops
 after learning that their usually chosen agro-input dealer received a poor
 rating.
 Alternatively, farmers may pressure their usual dealers to increase efforts.
 Dealers could also start improving on their own (i.e.
 without the pressure of farmers) after they have learned that their seed
 is rated poorly and want to improve their products.
 Lastly, dealers could also increase their efforts after seeing that they
 were rated well and feel motivated and satisfied due to this reward.
 [intentional vs.
 unintentional: seek information if don't know how to increase efforts]
 All these scenarios lead to seed of better quality, farmers purchasing
 better seed which improves their experiences by reducing risk and increasing
 profitability and later their perception of seed.
 Ultimately, this is expected to lead to increased adoption of improved
 maize seed.
 In the long run, the improved reputation of agro-input dealers could also
 boost seed producers' trust in them, which could lead to better support
 etc.

Robert's model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One could argue that Ugandan farmers can infer relatively fast which agro-input
 dealers provide good quality because they plant maize twice a year.
 However, these farmers might not trust their own judgement of quality even
 after using and experiencing the seed material.
 If farmers observe impressive yield and correctly infer that the quality
 of the seed they used is good, they perceive this as only one source, as
 only one observation.
 On the other hand, the aggregation of the experiences of many users may
 be a powerful way to reveal the quality of the product in a more trustworthy
 way.
 The extension literature

 shows that smallholders are more likely to trust information if it comes
 from more than one source, e.g.
 from a clearinghouse rating that is computed based on multiple opinions.

Level of randomization
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To evaluate the impact of the clearinghouse, we conduct an RCT.
 We randomize at the level of the 
\shape italic
catchment area
\shape default
.
 A catchment area is defined as the area that is served by an agro-input
 dealer, as the area where this shop's customers live.
 Dealers were listed during our census of all shops in 11 districts in southeast
ern Uganda.
 If the catchment areas of two or more shops overlap because these dealers
 operate in the same town, street or right next to each other, they are
 assigned to the same catchment area.
 This is done on the basis of geographical location.
 Using GPS coordinates of the dealers, the haversine function is used to
 construct an adjacency matrix, and dealers that are less than 5 kilometer
 apart are assigned to the same catchment area.
 The 5 kilometer threshold was selected based on visual inspection of the
 map, the size of an average village and reported distance between farmers
 and dealers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We randomize at catchment area level for three reasons.
 Firstly, because randomizing at the level of the individual agro-input
 shop prompted ethical concerns and it is important to think about the ethics
 of experimentation, especially when the participants are vulnerable 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "NBERw27600"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Often, dealers are clustered in towns, villages, markets, trading centers
 and other key market sheds.
 Two or more dealers may operate in the same neighborhood, or in the same
 street or even right next to each other.
 If we would randomize at shop level, one dealer may get assigned to the
 clearinghouse treatment group and receive a good rating, while his or her
 neighbor gets assigned to the clearinghouse control group and does not
 get the chance to receive any rating.
 Farmers may prefer the dealer with the rating, even though the seed quality
 of the control dealer may be similar or even better.
 The rating would in this case lead to a competitive advantage for the treated
 dealer, but the reverse may also be true if the treated dealer gets a poor
 rating.
 Randomizing at catchment area level reduces the risk of harming someone
 with our experiment.
 Secondly, it erases any spillover concerns.
 Otherwise treated dealers could inform control dealers nearby that they
 will be rated soon, which would contaminate the control group.
 Thirdly, randomizing at area level allows us to measure the effect of the
 clearinghouse on farmers.
 If we would randomize at shop level, one dealer may be rated but his or
 her neighbor may not.
 Some farmers would then have access to treated and control dealers, so
 that it would be difficult to distinguish treatment and control farmers.
 If we want to know if the clearinghouse leads to e.g.
 increased improved maize seed adoption among farmers, we need to be able
 to connect each farmer unambiguously to treatment or control.
 We ensure this by randomizing at the area level because then all dealers
 within an area are rated (or not) and all farmers within that area are
 potential customers of only dealers who are rated (or not).
 For these reasons we opted to randomize at the catchment area at the expense
 of statistical power, and collect data from a large sample to compensate
 for that.

We used simulations to determine the sample sizes for experiment.
 Simulating provides a flexible and intuitive way to analyze power.

 variables that take assumptions and return analytic solutions, simulations
 can sample from real data.
 Here, we use previously collected data from 78 agro-input dealers and 1,529
 smallholder farmers in the catchment areas of these dealers that were collected
 in three districts in eastern Uganda in July 2019

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We analyze power for outcomes at the agro-input dealer level and at the
 farmer level.
 To determine the sample size (defined in terms of the number of catchment
 areas), the algorithm iterates over different candidate sample sizes.
 For each candidate sample size, a random sample with replacement is drawn
 from the data.
 This sample is used to run a number of simulations of the experiment.
 Then we determine how often, out of the total number of simulations, we
 are able to detect the effect at the 5% significance level.
 This gives us the power associated with that particular candidate sample
 size.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once we determined the minimum number of catchment areas (and corresponding
 dealers) that are necessary to detect effects at the level of the agro-input
 dealer, we fix the number of areas and then determine the number of farmers
 we need to sample per dealer to the identify impact of the interventions
 on that level.
 As we allocate a fixed number of farmers to each dealer, we have slightly
 differing numbers of farmers in the different treatment groups, as the
 randomization happens at the catchment area level.
 While this may reduce power somewhat, it does not bias impact estimates.
 We iterate over different candidate sample sizes of farmers per dealer.
 The resulting sample in each iterations is used to run a number of simulations
 of the experiment.
 We again determine how often, out of the total number of simulations, we
 were able to detect the effect at the 5% significance level, which will
 give us the power associated to that iteration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that if the number of catchment areas is larger than 112, our experiment
s will return statistically significant results 80% of the time.
 This corresponds to about 318 agro-input dealers.
 Based on further simulations, we decided to collect information on 10 farmers
 per dealer, leading to a sample size of 3,200 households.

Collection of ratings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we collected baseline data from smallholder farmers, we also asked
 them to rate dealers in their proximity on a number of characteristics.
 Names, locations, descriptions and photos of the shops were preloaded onto
 the tablet computers used for data collection and the relevant dealers
 and questions showed up automatically.
 It may be argued that by asking farmers to rate agro-input dealers in a
 particular area, you are also making farmers aware of the existence of
 all agro-input dealers in the area, and this awareness effect may potentially
 confound the clearinghouse effect.
 We thus also iterate through the agro-input dealers for control subjects,
 to make control farmers similarly aware of the existence of agro-input
 dealers in their vicinity.
 However, control farmers are not asked to rate dealers as the process of
 rating and thinking about a dealer's seed could make quality more salient,
 and is therefore part of the treatment.

 They introduced a "Yellow Pages" phone directory with contact information

 They find that enterprises randomly assigned to be listed in the directory

 more likely to employ workers.
 As we are not interested in this kind of knowledge effect, i.e.
 farmers knowing which dealers operate in their proximity, we also disseminate
 control dealer information, so that we are able to measure the pure clearinghou
se effect of making unobservable seed quality observable.
 An additional advantage is that control farmers will also believe that
 they are somehow treated, so that treated and control farmers will adjust
 their behavior similarly

We evaluate the effect of the clearinghouse intervention and investigate

 Testing hypotheses regarding multiple outcomes calls for special techniques
 because the probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis for at least
 one outcome is larger than the significance level used for each test 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 That is why we account for multiple hypothesis testing by aggregating families

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Combining outcomes in indices is a common strategy against over-rejection
 of the null hypothesis due to multiple inference.
 This approach is useful to see whether a treatment has a positive overall
 impact.
 For instance, it is interesting to group primary outcome variables at the
 agro-input dealer level to see if the clearinghouse treatment generally
 has a positive impact on dealers.
 However, interpreting these effects can be difficult.
 Furthermore, we remain interested in individual outcomes because they inform
 us about the different channels of impact.
 It is interesting to see whether e.g.
 the seed handling practices, efforts and services of dealers improved at
 midline due to the clearinghouse, even though the overall index of primary
 dealer outcomes might not have significantly changed, yet.
 That is why, in addition to reporting the treatment effects on these indices,
 we will report the treatment effects on individual outcome variables.
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
An alternative strategy to deal with multiple comparisons is to adjust the
 significance levels according to family-wise error rates.
 Here individual coefficients are considered to be part of a family of n
 hypotheses.
 The family-wise error rate is the probability of at least one type I error
 in this family.
 We can maintain the family-wise error rate at some level alpha like 0.05
 by adjusting the p-values used to test each individual null hypothesis
 in the family 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "multiple"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The simplest of these methods is the Bonferroni adjustment, where alpha/n
 are used as critical values.
 For instance, if one would like to test 20 hypotheses, the cutoff p-value
 for testing each individual outcome would be less than 0.0025 so that the
 family-wise error rate remains at the 0.05 level.
 The downside of this method is that it assumes that outcomes are independent,
 rendering it too conservative when outcomes are correlated.
 That is why we adjust while accounting for correlation, an approach used
 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 and later by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "aker2012zap"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In this procedure the adjusted p-value depends on the number of outcomes
 being tested, the unadjusted p-value for an outcome, and the mean correlation
 among the other outcomes.
 If outcomes are independent, then the procedure is equal to the Bonferroni
 adjustment.
 If the outcomes are perfectly correlated, the adjusted p-value is equivalent
 to the unadjusted p-value.

Our sample consists of agro-input dealers and smallholder maize farmers

 1 to 18 dealers operate in an area, with a mean of 2.7.

\begin_layout Standard
To connect agro-input shops and villages, we asked every dealer where most

 Then enumerators were instructed to randomly sample ten households that
 grow maize in these villages.
 Consequently, about 3500 smallholder maize farmers were sampled, sufficient
 to detect treatment effects according to our power simulations.

We measure the outcomes of interest before and after the intervention, so
 that we can condition the treatment effect estimates on baseline values
 of the outcome variables to increase power.
 Baseline data was collected from dealers in September and October 2020
 and from farmers in April 2021.
 Midline data was collected in January and in February 2022, and endline

.
 When enumerators approached a shop to interview the dealer, they tried
 to talk to the person who is most knowledgeable about the day to day operations
 of the business, inventories, sales, and so on.
 The average respondent is 32 years old.
 60% are male and more than 90% finished primary education.
 In 55% of the cases, the respondent is the owner of the shop.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We see substantial heterogeneity among agro-input shops.
 Some are small informal stores which are located in rural areas and sell
 maize seed only during the planting season whilst usually selling other
 products.
 Others have many customers, are efficient, located in towns and specialized
 in inputs and equipment used in agricultural production.
 The average shop was established 5 years ago and is located 7 kilometers
 from the nearest tarmac road.
 It has 41 customers per day.
 74% are specialized shops which only sell farm inputs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also collected a variety of variables related to the quality of maize
 seed sold at these agro-input shops.
 Enumerators asked if they could inspect the area where seed is stored and
 noted that there is quite some room for improvement.
 65% of shops have problems with pests like rats or insects and 16% store
 maize seed in open containers.
 When we asked dealers about the services they provide, around half reported
 to offer credit and extension or training.
 On the other hand, 2 in 3 shops received a complaint about seed they sold
 from a customer since last season.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also purchased a bag of maize seed.
 However, only 232 of the 348 shops in our sample had seed in stock at the
 time of the baseline interview.
 We measured the moisture in the bag and found that it was 13.6% on average,
 with a minimum of 10.3 and a maximum of 17.4.
 Note that seed moisture content determines whether molds and storage pests
 thrive, so that moisture should stay below 13%.
 While 68% of seed bags show a packaging date, only 18% show an expiry date,
 and 8% show a certification sticker.
\begin_inset Note Note
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Interestingly, when asked to rate the product quality of an agro-input shop
 on a scale of 1 to 5, dealers rated themselves significantly better than
 farmers did.
 It is also interesting to note that farmers who bought seed at a particular
 agro-input shop rate this shop's seed significantly worse than farmers
 who did not.
 Both comparisons can only be made for clearinghouse treated dealers and
 farmers because control dealers were not rated at baseline, and control
 farmers did not rate at baseline.

 When approaching a household, enumerators were instructed to interview
 the person who is most knowledgeable about maize farming.
 However, a set of questions deals with the household head, who could be
 or could not be the respondent.
 78% of household heads in our sample are male, 51% have finished primary
 education.
 The average household head is 49 years old.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On average, 9 people belong to one household and share 3 rooms.
 The homestead is located 4 kilometers from the nearest agro-input shop
 and 9 kilometers from the nearest tarmac road.
 The average farmer started growing maize 23 years ago and has 3 acres of
 land for crop production.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Half of the farmers in our sample adopted improved maize seed on at least
 one of their fields last season.
 Of these adopting farmers, 2 out of 3 bought seed at an agro-input shop.
 Baseline data also shows that quality is an important factor when farmers
 decide whether and where to buy maize seed.
 When we asked farmers for the most important reason why they bought seed
 at an agro-input shop last season, seed there being of very good quality
 was the most frequent answer with 58%.
 On the other hand, when we asked farmers for the most important reason
 why they did not buy seed at an agro-input shop last season, quality concerns
 were the second most frequent answer (after the shop being too expensive).

\begin_layout Standard
Only 25% applied chemical fertilizers like Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP) or
 Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium (NPK) on a randomly selected maize
 field.
 Productivity is low with 500 kilograms per acre.
 Interestingly, farmers who adopted improved maize seed harvested 589 kilograms
 (worth 413 000 Ugandan shillings (UGX)) per acre on average, whereas farmers
 who did not harvested 424 kilograms (worth 299 000 UGX) per acre, meaning
 that adopting farmers had 39% more yield (worth 114 000 UGX) per acre.
 However, farmers who adopted report to have spent on average 32 000 UGX
 per acre on seed material, farmers who did not 1 000 UGX per acre.
 This results in a difference of 31 000 UGX per acre in seed costs, meaning
 that adopting farmers almost quadrupled their investment.

Randomization balance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test if treatment and control groups are comparable in terms of a set
 of baseline characteristics, i.e.
 to test for balance at baseline, we include standard orthogonality tables
 with pre-registered variables (Tables 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "balance_dealer"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "balance_farmer"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Some of these characteristics are unlikely to be affected by the intervention,
 while others are picked from the primary and secondary outcomes.
 None of the pre-registered baseline characteristics is significantly different
 between treated and control dealers and farmers.

This section presents results on the impact of the clearinghouse intervention.
 We investigate a set of primary outcomes and various secondary outcomes
 to explore the effects in more detail, to identify steps along the causal
 chain and understand the mechanisms at work.
 As farmers and agro-input dealers are targeted by the intervention, we
 will assess changes in outcomes at both levels.
 Note that all outcome variables have been registered in a pre-analysis
 plan which can be found on the

target "https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/6361"

 Additionally, we completed the entire econometric analysis on simulated

.
 The index of capital-intensive practices contains different shop attributes
 which are associated with seed handling and storage but come along with
 an investment.
 Examples of these attributes are the quality of the roof, walls, and ventilatio
n of the shop, and whether or not there are any official inspection, training
 or registration certificates displayed in the store.
 All this was observed by our enumerators who inspected the area where seed
 was stored.
 But also questions like what is usually done with expired seed, e.g.
 is it sold, thrown away or mixed with other seed, are included in this
 index.
 On the other hand, the index of labor-intensive seed handling consists
 of practices that are not expensive or even for free.
 Examples include whether seed is stored in a dedicated area, on an appropriate
 surface and in appropriate lighting, or in open bags or containers.
 Other variables that are not necessarily related to an investment like
 the cleanness and professionality of the shop, and whether there are problems
 with rats, insects or other pests also contribute to this index.
 The index of all seed handling practices contains both sets of variables.
 The index of efforts and services measures a range of outcomes related
 to the customer friendliness of the shop, e.g.
 whether the dealer offers explanations, recommendations, extension or training,
 discounts, credit, different payment modalities but also what the smallest
 package of seed is and a question related to customers complaints.

, which are related to yield, drought, pest and disease tolerance, germination
 etc.
 Farmers were asked to provide these ratings, circling through all dealers
 within the relevant catchment area.
 Then these farmer ratings are aggregated at shop level (as one shop is
 rated by multiple farmers), and the index is computed.

Most estimates go in the expected direction.
 For instance, we find that treated dealers sell 200 kilograms more maize
 seed, corresponding to a 20% increase over the mean.
 However, the coefficients have not been estimated precisely enough to yield
 a significant effect at conventional significance levels.
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that the index of maize seed ratings by farmers is a pre-registered
 outcome variable but that treatment and control groups cannot be compared,
 yet.
 At baseline and midline, only clearinghouse treated farmers rated dealers
 in their proximity because being confronted with these questions is part
 of the treatment, so that the answers are only collected for households
 in treated catchment areas.
 Hence control dealers were not rated, yet, and this line is left blank.
 At endline, all farmers will rate and all shops will be rated, so that
 this variable can be investigated then.

Bjorn: During midline we see an increase in the likelihood that farmers
 switch from agro-input dealers by 4.1 percentage points.
 In the endline this is only 2.6 percent (and not significant anymore).
 This suggests that even a single round of ratings may have long run effects
 (or something like that )? Caro: But at endline farmers had been treated
 twice, so the 2.6 isn't only the long run effect of the 1st treatment but
 also the short term effect on the 2nd treatment, so treating them again
 doesn’t seem to affect farmers' behavior that much.
 This could be because: a) farmers start realizing that the ratings are
 "random" and cannot be trusted i.e.
 Travis' argument that farmers can actually not judge seed quality b) farmers
 have already switched to better dealers at midline, so they are already
 choosing the best dealers in their neighborhood i.e.
 there's little room for better choices.
 Bjorn: When I was talking about the long run effect, I was not referring
 to the 2.6, but to all the other improvements to only appear after season
 2 like the increase in productivity.
 So I think it is definitely b.

 Here, the individual ratings are aggregated at farmer level (as one farmer

 location, price, seed quality, stock, and reputation.
 Again the ratings are aggregated at farmer level.

 For the index of efforts and services provided by the dealer, farmers were
 asked whether a shop nearby offers refund or insurance if there is a problem,
 credit, training or advice on how to use seed, delivery, after-sales service,
 accepts different payment methods and sells small quantities.
 The answers are aggregated at shop level and then the index is computed
 at farmer level.
 The index of farmer’s practices on a randomly selected maize field contains
 questions related to the number and spacing of seeds, weeding, timing of
 planting, re-sowing, and the use of organic manure, DAP, NPK, Urea, pesticides,
 herbicides and fungicides etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again, we find that most estimates go in the expected direction.
 In the treatment group, farmers are more likely to adopt improved maize
 seed and less likely to think seed from input shops is adulterated.
 However, most of the coefficients are not significant.

 We do find that treated farmers are significantly more likely to indicate
 that the shop they bought maize seed from for the last season was not the
 same shop they bought seed from for the previous season(s).
 Compared to the control group, treated farmers are 5 percentage points
 more likely to have switched to a different agro-input shop.
 Note that we expected farmers to switch from low rated shops to higher
 rated shops, as illustrated in Figure

 An index of motivation and satisfaction summarizes the answers to questions
 like whether dealers see themselves working as dealers in the future, whether
 they think their job makes a positive difference, how likely they are to
 recommend working as dealers, or how happy they feel when they come to
 work.
 For the index of self-ratings, dealers were asked to rate themselves on
 location, price, product quality, stock, and reputation.
 For the index of efforts and services, farmers were asked whether a shop
 offers services like refunds or credits as described above.
 Here the answers to those questions are aggregated at the dealer level
 and then the index is computed.
 To investigate changes in skills and knowledge, we construct two more indices.
 The index of knowledge particularly related to seed storage is based on
 answers to questions about seed viability, repackaging, and the optimal
 location to store seed.
 For the index of knowledge about seed, dealers were asked about the yield
 benefits of improved maize seed and which variety they would recommend
 if a farmer needs fast maturing seed or complains about poor soil or little
 rain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Farmers report that dealers in treated catchment areas invest significantly
 more effort and provide significantly better services.
 Also, given that any 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 index ranges from minus one to one with a mean of zero, a coefficient of
 0.23 is quite substantial.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 We expected dealers to increase their efforts due to pressure by farmers,

 For the other indices, we do not find any measurable impact.

The clearinghouse could lead dealers to voluntarily expose themselves to
 increased scrutiny to signal farmers that they deliver quality products.
 That is why we ask whether the shop is a member of Uganda National Agro-Input
 Dealers' Association (UNADA) or any other professional association, whether
 it has a trading license, and some questions related to inspection.

Furthermore, enumerators purchased a random

 provides the results.
 We see that bags which were purchased from treated agro-input dealers are
 0.29 percentage points more likely to show a packaging date and that this
 difference is significant at the 10% level.
 This could be an indication of better seed quality in the clearinghouse
 treatment group, as seed is less likely to have been repackaged if this
 date is visible on the bag.
 The remaining coefficients are insignificant.

Farmer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To explore impact pathways at the level of the farmer, we often consider
 outcomes at the plot level.
 For some outcome variables, e.g.
 seed spacing or rate, details at the plot level are needed.
 However, farmers often have more than one field.
 As outcomes on different plots from the same farmer are likely to be strongly
 correlated, it is not cost effective to ask questions about all fields.
 An unbiased estimate of the outcome at the household level can be obtained
 by randomly selecting one plot.
 To do so, we ask enumerators to first list all fields, with names farmers
 use to refer to these plots (e.g.
 home plot, plot near the sugar cane factory).
 The Computer-Assisted Personal Interviews software then randomly selects
 one plot for which detailed questions are asked.

In Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we zoom in on the particular 
\shape italic
maize seed that farmers used
\shape default
 on a randomly selected field, and investigate farmers' quality perceptions.
 For the rating index, farmers were asked to rate this seed in terms of
 general quality, yield, drought, pest and disease tolerance, early maturity,
 (output) market price and demand, (input) price, availability, and germination
 rate.
 We see that farmers in the treatment group rate seed they used significantly
 better, meaning that their quality perceptions changed due to the treatment.
 Note that we cannot compare farmers' ratings of the maize seed at agro-input
 shops, yet, which is the main focus of this study, as control farmers did
 so far not rate dealers because rating is part of the treatment.
 Considering that 42% of the seed farmers used on the random field was bought
 at an agro-input shop, see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "results_farmer_sec: plot adoption"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, this coefficient could be an indication that farmers' perception of seed
 at shops also changed due to the clearinghouse treatment.
 When we have collected the ratings from the entire sample at endline, we
 will be able to see whether this is in fact the case.
 All coefficients in this table go into the expected direction, so that
 also the overall index changed significantly.

Specialized agro-input shops
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we asked agro-input dealers during baseline data collection whether
 their shop only sells farm inputs, 74% answered with yes, while 26% reported
 to also sell other products.
 The results of rerunning the analysis for specialized shops only can be
 found in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "results_dealer_prim_het1"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Treated specialized shops earn significantly more revenue from selling
 maize seed than specialized shops in the control group, whereas we previously
 did not find any treatment effect on primary outcomes at dealer level.
 Revenue could have increased because the clearinghouse's effect on efforts
 and services is larger for this subset of dealers.
 For these specialized shops, the treatment also reduced the shelf-life
 of stored seed significantly.
 A seed bag's shelf-life is an important indication of its quality.
 Treated specialized dealers stock seed which is on average 79 days younger
 than seed stocked by control dealers, while the sample mean is 150 days.
 Treated specialized dealers also sell significantly more Longe 10H.
 All this could explain why specialized shops in treated catchment areas
 enjoy a higher revenue than specialized shops in control areas and indicates
 that the clearinghouse has a stronger impact on specialized agro-input
 dealers.
 An explanation could be that dealers who only sell inputs and equipment
 used in agricultural production take the maize seed ratings more serious
 because they concern their only business, while shops which also sell other
 products face less risk due to risk spreading.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
More competitive catchment areas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sample contains 46 catchment areas with only one dealer.
 Excluding these smallest clusters leaves us with 302 shops and 3020 farmers
 in 84 areas.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "results_farmer_het2"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 reports that within this subset of more competitive areas, the clearinghouse
 has a slightly larger effect on the switching of farmers to different agro-inpu
t shops.
 According to farmers, the difference in efforts and services between treatment
 and control group is larger in these areas and significant at the 1% level.
 For areas with more than one dealer, the difference in likelihood of packaging
 dates being visible on maize seed bags is also larger than for the full
 sample.
 Together, this could indicate that the clearinghouse works better in areas
 with several shops and that our results for the entire sample are driven
 by these dealers.
 This stands to reason because in areas with only one shop, it is less easy
 for farmers to switch and dealers could be less inclined to increase their
 efforts if there is no threat of competition nearby.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Shops that were rated
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the first round, 8% of dealers in the clearinghouse treatment group were
 not rated by a single farmer, e.g.
 because no farmer in our sample knew them, so we exclude these shops and
 rerun the analysis.
 For this sub-sample, the difference between treated and control dealers
 in terms of efforts and services is larger and significant at the 1% level.
 As shown in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "results_dealer_sec_het4"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we also find a significant impact on the overall index summarizing variables
 related to the bag of maize seed.
 This result is driven by the shelf-life variable, an important indication
 of seed quality.
 In conclusion, the impact of the clearinghouse seems stronger for shops
 that were actually rated than for those who were supposed to be but not
 actually rated, which is what one would expect.

\begin_layout Standard
Whether our estimates are biased or not depends on whether this attrition
 is random or not.
 For instance, it is plausible that enumerators invested less effort when
 searching control dealers because they did not have to deliver their SeedAdviso
r certificates.
 Carrying this certificate might have made them more persistent when looking
 for a shop because they did not want to return to their supervisor without
 having delivered that paper.
 Moreover, the certificate might have helped enumerators to find the treated
 dealers because they were able to show the names to neighbors etc.
 (instead of just asking) who in turn helped finding them.
 In that case, a larger number of random dealers left the control sample,
 meaning that the dealers who were not found are not different from the
 ones that were found.
 The sub-sample of dealers that remained in the control group would then
 be representative for the entire control group, hence our estimates would
 be unbiased.
 Attrition would only reduce power.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, a non-random subset of agro-input dealers might have
 left the sample, meaning that attritors and non-attritors differ significantly,
 which could bias our results.
 It is for instance plausible that the worst performing shops in the clearinghou
se control group went bankrupt.
 Our clearinghouse treatment might have prevented bankruptcy and helped
 dealers to stay in the market because it served as some kind of advertisement
 if the rating was good.
 When attrition bias is likely to be negative and treatment effects are
 expected to be positive, the unadjusted selection-contaminated estimates
 provide

 However, we refrain from doing so at this point because our ordinary estimates
 are lower bounds for the true effect and therefore the most conservative
 estimates.
 If, after increasing our efforts to find every dealer during endline data
 collection, attrition remains correlated with the treatment status, we
 will estimate the upper bounds.

\begin_layout Standard
When farmers were asked why they bought maize seed at a particular agro-input
 shop, a couple of clearinghouse treated farmers named the shop's high SeedAdvis
or rating as the most important reason during the midline interview.
 Also the results of our analyses show that several outcome variables change
 in response to the clearinghouse treatment, and behave the way the theory
 of change in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "figure: Theory of change"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 predicted.
 These changes, even though often not robust to multiple hypothesis testing,
 can be interpreted as first indications of an impact.
 Note that the reported unadjusted estimates are likely to be rather conservativ
e lower bounds for the true effect as attrition bias is negative and the
 treatment effect is positive.
 Also note that at this point in time, ratings have been disseminated only
 once, and that changing farmer and dealer behavior is likely to take some
 time.
 If the clearinghouse triggers farmers to choose better dealers and dealers
 to increase their efforts, so that farmers purchase better seed, then it
 still takes another agricultural season for farmers to have better experiences,
 perceive seed to be better and ultimately increase improved maize seed
 adoption.
 Endline data will show whether the clearinghouse has a substantial impact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objective of the clearinghouse is to make maize seed quality observable,
 so that its functioning would be endangered if farmers' ratings do not
 actually measure seed quality but e.g.
 the personal relationship between a farmer and a dealer.
 Some could even argue that farmers cannot assess the quality of maize seed
 at all, not even after using it, because there are so many factors at play
 in agricultural production: if farmers experience a disappointing harvest,
 they cannot safely conclude that the seed material was poor because it
 could have also been poor soil, insufficient, late or too much rain, or
 own mismanagement like late planting or insufficient weeding.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Misattribution occurs when farmers mistakenly ascribe bad outcomes to bad
 inputs, rather than to other possible causes.
 Learning about the true quality becomes more difficult when this misattribution
 is present (Hoel et al., 2021).
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 agree that sub-Saharan Africa's soil heterogeneity hampers farmer learning
 about the returns to inputs.
 Also 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 find that farmers in developing countries routinely misperceive input quality.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Maize seed would then be a credence good instead of an experience good
 and clearinghouse ratings of farmers would be useless.
 Even though farmers and dealers might still change their behaviour in the
 short run because they expect the clearinghouse to work, this effect would
 fade out as soon as both actors learn that the ratings are unreliable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We argue that farmers’ ability to infer maize seed quality is indeed not
 perfect but they can assess it to some extent.
 Shortly after planting, farmers can observe germination rates, i.e.
 the proportion of seeds that germinate, and later how fast the seed matures.
 Some seed may also be more susceptible to pests and diseases, while other
 seed may be particularly tolerant in terms of drought.
 After harvest, the farmer can observe the yield.
 All these attributes of seed quality can be judged to some extent after
 one agricultural season.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To support our claim, we test whether the ratings are correlated with seed
 quality.
 Even though objectively measuring seed quality is challenging and DNA fingerpri
nting is the only reliable way to detect varietal purity, we were able to
 check whether ratings are correlated with other objective indications of
 seed quality.

Note that this was only done for treated shops because control shops had
 not been rated at baseline, yet.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We find that specialized agro-input shops which only sell farm inputs have
 higher ratings.
 Dealers who did not receive any customer complaint about seed they sold
 since last season have higher ratings than dealers who did.
 Furthermore, farmers did not only rate the seed of agro-input shops but
 also the seed they used on a randomly selected maize field, using the same
 questions.
 We find that an index of these seed ratings is positively correlated with
 farmers' yield.
 All this shows that the clearinghouse ratings do measure maize seed quality
 to some extent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some could also argue that the clearinghouse is unlikely to work in areas
 with only one agro-input dealer who faces no competition
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In our sample, 46 of 130 catchment areas or 35 percent have only one dealer.
\end_layout

\end_inset

, as farmers could not switch to better dealers and dealers would have no
 incentive to improve their services and increase their efforts.
 However, the clearinghouse will still work if dealers are not fully aware
 of their lack of competiton or if they fear that farmers switch to dealers
 in a different area and for example go to a nearby town to buy seed.
 Even if farmers are strictly unable to switch and dealers are fully informed
 about this, the clearinghouse will work.
 If a dealer provides great seed but farmers do not know this, the clearinghouse
 could correct this perception and increase adoption.
 Farmers could also apply social pressure on poorly performing dealers,
 even if they cannot switch to the competition.
 Dealers could also start improving due to their pride if they receive a
 poor rating, or due to increased motivation if they receive a good one.
 That is why we argue that a clearinghouse will also work in areas without
 dealer competition.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another danger to the functioning of the clearinghouse could be agro-input
 dealers who start to influence ratings in a dishonest manner, e.g.
 by faking ratings or by bribing farmers.
 Note that during this trial, rating and rated participants were connected
 by asking dealers where their customers come from, and collecting ratings
 from ten random farmers in that village.
 Dealers would need to understand our experimental design in order to know
 which farmer they would need to influence.
 That is why it is almost impossible that dealers cheat during this trial.
 However, if the clearinghouse intervention would be scaled up, these kind
 of challenges would need to be addressed.
 However, the objective of this paper is to test whether a prediction of
 the theory occurs in practice, namely whether making seed quality observable
 improves quality and ultimately adoption, and not to provide a policy intervent
ion, sophisticated enough to be applied without further considerations.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though agricultural technologies like high yielding seed varieties
 and fertilizers are seen as the key to agricultural productivity, the adoption
 by smallholders remains persistently low in sub-Saharan Africa, which hinders
 poverty alleviation at the individual and aggregate level.
 We study a particular constraint to technology adoption: the perceived
 quality of agricultural inputs like improved maize seed.
 We hypothesize that the intentional and unintentional malpractices of agro-inpu
t dealers lead to poor seed quality, resulting in under-adoption by farmers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To assess the importance of this potential constraint to agricultural technology
 adoption, we test an intervention which reduces the information asymmetry
 between seller and buyer by making the quality of maize seed observable.
 To this end, we implement an information clearinghouse that is based on
 crowd-sourced ratings in the market for seed.
 This clearinghouse is tested in a randomized controlled trial among 350
 agro-input dealers and 3500 smallholder maize farmers in Uganda.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis of midline data shows first indications of an impact.
 Heterogeneity analysis suggests that the information clearinghouse works
 better for agro-input dealers who only sell farm inputs and who were actually
 rated by farmers.
 The intervention also has a larger effect in areas with more competition.
 However, endline data has to be analyzed before we can draw final conclusions.

\begin_layout Paragraph*
What to do if a treated dealer does not receive a single rating?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a shop in a treated catchment area is not rated by a single farmer, e.g.
 because no farmer in our sample knows him or her, we could fill in the
 catchment area mean as his or her rating.
 However, this is not as innocent as it seems because it is likely that
 the lack of ratings is not random.
 Poor quality dealers have less customers, so their likelihood to get rated
 is lower.
 Giving them average catchment area ratings inflates the ratings of these
 low quality dealers.
 Instead, we simply told farmers that we do not have information about this
 shop (implicitly informing the farmer that it exists).
 16 of 193 treated dealers were not rated by a single farmer in the first
 round.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Should more ratings lead to better ratings?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some shops were not rated by any smallholder in the first round, while others
 were rated by up to 22 smallholders.
 If dealer A is rated by 10 farmers and gets rating 3,5 and dealer B is
 rated by 1 farmer and gets rating 3,6, we treat dealer B as the better
 dealer.
 Even though receiving many (few) ratings can be related to good (poor)
 quality (the lack of ratings could be nonrandom, see previous paragraph),
 there could be other reasons why dealers are rated by many (few) farmers.
 Furthermore, giving higher ratings to better-known dealers could harm new
 dealers entering the market and dealers who are discriminated, e.g.
 due to their gender.
 Also on TripAdvisor, having more reviews than a rival hotel does not lead
 to a better rating.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Should ratings depend on catchment area dealer performance?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following examples show that ratings should not depend on catchment
 area averages.
 In an area with poor quality dealers in which one dealer is a bit better
 than the rest but still poor, we do not want this dealer to be rated well
 (i.e.
 expose farmers to poor quality dealers).
 Similarly, in an area with good dealers in which one dealer is a bit worse
 than the rest but still good, we do not want this dealer to be rated poorly
 (which would be unfair towards him or her).
 On the other hand, less than 9% of shops received a rating below 3 out
 of 5, so we would throw away valuable data if we would only disseminate
 good scores without any variation.
 Therefore, we take the distribution of ratings into account by using quintiles.
 Consequently, less dealers receive rating 4 or 5, more dealers receive
 rating 1 or 2.
 This could strengthen the effect of the treatment on dealer effort.
 If dealers get ratings 1 or 2 instead of 4 or 5, they could feel more inclined
 to improve their scores.
 Consequently, also the effect on seed quality itself could be larger.
 However, the clearinghouse should also have a signaling effect, which might
 be weaker if more dealers are rated 1 or 2 instead of 4 or 5 (dealers would
 seem to be of worse quality to farmers).
 Therefore, we chose words with a positive connotation as the quintile names
 for rating dissemination.
 As most dealers received a good or very good rating before taking the distribut
ion into account, we ensure that even a 2 is still communicated as "good"
 to farmers to not weaken the signaling effect.
 That is why the first quintile is translated to "okay" and gets one star,
 the second one is named "good" and receives two stars, the third quintile
 is "very good" and gets three stars, the fourth and fifth one are "excellent"
 and awarded with four and five stars.
 This way of considering the distribution of the original ratings when choosing
 the names also helps us to disseminate ratings as truthfully, purely and
 as closely to reality as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Are female dealers rated worse than male dealers?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because we found significant differences between the ratings of female (41%
 of dealers) and male agro-input dealers (59% of dealers) after controlling
 for some potentially confounding variables like education and for several
 indications of quality, we have no reason to believe that these differences
 in perception can be explained by differences in real quality.
 Instead, it is likely that women are perceived to be worse due to discriminatio
n 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "De2022"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, so that we adjusted the ratings of female dealers accordingly to prevent
 that they are harmed by our intervention.
 We regressed all seed quality attributes on the gender dummy and added
 the resulting coefficients to the initial ratings of female dealers.
