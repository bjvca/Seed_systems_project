The (perceived) quality of agricultural technology and its adoption: Experimenta
l evidence from Uganda
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Recently, issues related to the (perceived) quality of inputs and technologies
 have been proposed as an important constraint to their adoption by smallholder
 farmers in low income countries.
 Taking maize seed embodying genetic gain as a case, we train random agro-dealer
s to test whether under-adoption by farmers is caused by low quality due
 to sellers’ lack of knowledge about proper storage and handling.
 In a second hypothesis, we randomly introduce an information clearinghouse
 similar to popular crowd-sourced review platforms such as yelp.com or trustpilot.
com to test whether information asymmetries crowd out quality seed.
 We find that the information clearinghouse treatment improves outcomes
 for both agro-dealers and farmers, with agro-dealers receiving more customers
 and reporting higher revenues from maize seed sales, and farmers reporting
 significantly higher use of improved maize seed varieties obtained from
 agro-dealers, leading to higher maize productivity after two seasons.
 The primary mechanisms behind this impact appear to be an increased effort
 to signal quality by agro-dealers and a general restoration of trust in
 the market for improved seed.
 The agro-dealer training does not have a clear impact on agro-dealers,
 nor on farmers in associated catchment areas.
 However, we do find that the information clearinghouse increases agro-dealer
 knowledge about proper seed storage and handling.
 Upon exploring interaction effects between the training and the clearinghouse
 treatment, we also find that the training becomes effective for agro-dealers
 that are also in the clearinghouse treatment group.
 This underscores the importance of incentives to make supply side interventions
 such as trainings effective.

The adoption of new agricultural inputs and technologies (such as seed embodying
 genetic gain, inorganic fertilizers, or agro-chemicals) remains tepid in
 areas where they can make the largest difference in terms of food security,
 poverty reduction, and biodiversity preservation

 Several explanations for the low uptake of agricultural technology among
 small-scale, resource-poor farmers in low- and middle-income countries
 have been explored and tested with increasing depth and rigor in recent
 years.
 These include access to information about existence, use, and benefits
 of the technology

 build on the observation that farmers generally cannot easily assess quality
 from visual inspection at the time of purchase, so information asymmetries
 between sellers and buyers characterize the market for agricultural inputs,
 in turn crowding out the market for quality inputs in Uganda, similar to
 the lessons learned from

 However, subsequent research suggests ambiguity in whether these quality
 issues are attributable to agro-dealers intentionally adulterating their
 products, or whether they lack the requisite knowledge and skills to preserve
 quality

\begin_layout Standard
We investigate some of these issues through a field experiment conducted
 with both agro-dealers and smallholder farmers in their catchment areas
 in the nascent market for improved, high-yielding maize varieties in eastern
 Uganda.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the context of this study, high-yielding maize varieties refers to both
 open-pollinated varieties and hybrids.
 While the distinction may be lost on some, it is a nuance that is recognizable
 to many colleagues working in the fields of plant breeding and seed sector
 development.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We focus partly on agro-dealers because they are an essential marketing
 channel for inputs and technologies in countries with large smallholder
 farmer populations living in remote areas with poor infrastructure.
 A reasonably dense network of semi-formal agro-dealers provides access
 to seed, fertilizer, agro-chemicals, and tools, and may be combined to
 provide agricultural advisory services and credit facilities, both formal
 or informal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yet small-scale agro-dealers may also be weak links in the supply chain
 for quality inputs.
 For instance, the semi-formal nature and scale of agro-dealers may mean
 they lack knowledge on proper handling and storage of agro-inputs.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "BARRIGA2020104928"

\end_inset

 document various issues related to handling and storage that may reduce
 input quality in the Ugandan seed supply chain.
 For example, agro-dealers often repack seed from larger bags packed by
 seed companies into smaller bags in order to offer quantities that are
 convenient and affordable to smallholders.
 As a result, important information including variety name, expiry date,
 or planting instructions are lost, while the material used for re-packaging—air
-tight polyethylene bags—affect aeration, moisture, and seed viability.
 Other agro-dealers sell from open bags, which can similarly lower seed
 viability 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bold2017lemon"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In a first hypothesis, we thus posit that simply providing information
 to agro-dealers will increase seed quality and subsequently improve farmers'
 product experience, ultimately encouraging them to adopt improved maize
 varieties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, we recognize that providing information only to agro-dealers may
 not necessarily remedy the fact that seed quality cannot easily be observed
 by farmers.
 Furthermore, we expect that small scale agro-dealers are subjected to less
 regulation and oversight than their larger counterparts in manufacturing,
 import, or wholesale operations that are situated further up the supply
 chain.
 This means that agro-dealers may still be incentivized—even with training—to
 underinvest in quality management and preservation.
 In a context similar to ours, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hoffmann2021observability"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 examine maize (grain, not seed) in rural Kenyan markets and find an absence
 of incentives for sellers to address food safety problems because they
 are not observable to their buyers.
 The same issue carries into seed markets, and in a worst-case scenario,
 agro-dealers may intentionally sacrifice quality to reduce costs and increase
 profits, e.g., by mixing improved or fresh seed with local or old seed, or
 even with grain.
 There is some evidence that may be consistent with this kind of adulteration
 and counterfeiting in the Ugandan agricultural input supply chain.

 that 30% of nutrient is missing in fertilizer.

 find that the average bottle of herbicide is missing 15% of the active
 ingredient and nearly one in three bottles contains less than 75% of the
 ingredient advertised.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But even in cases where agro-dealers provide quality inputs, the fact that
 quality can not be easily assessed by farmers at the time of purchase may
 be problematic if farmers hold negatively skewed cognitive beliefs about
 seed quality sold by agro-dealers.
\begin_inset Foot

There are many reasons why these beliefs are likely to be biased downwards,
 including negativity bias and loss aversion

 show that farmers in Nigeria routinely misperceive the cassava variety

 potentially improve farmers’ investment choices and productivity outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a second hypothesis, we conjecture that making quality observable to
 both buyers and sellers will increase adoption through various mechanisms.
 First, buyers may shift from sellers that sell low quality inputs to sellers
 that provide high quality inputs.
 Second, sellers may start to compete on quality, either by increasing quality
 if there is still room for improvement, or by making the quality attribute
 of their products more salient to buyers.
 Finally, in light of the new information, farmers may adjust their perceptions
 of the quality of technologies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two hypotheses are tested in a randomized control trial (RCT) among
 350 agro-dealers and an associated 3,500 smallholder maize farmers in their
 catchment areas in eastern Uganda over the course of two agricultural seasons.
 The first hypothesis involves a fairly standard intervention where we provide
 a one day training for agro-dealership owners and managers on proper storage
 and handling of seed.
 For the second hypothesis, we build on 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hasanain2019no"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and implement a decentralized information clearinghouse that is based on
 crowd-sourced information on quality provided by agro-dealers which is
 then aggregated and made public, much like yelp.com or tripadvisor.com.
 In particular, we ask farmers to provide star ratings to agro-dealers in
 their vicinity, and use these ratings to construct scores and rank agro-dealers.
 We then disseminate these scores to farmers.
 We also provide the score, together with their relative position in the
 rankings, to the agro-dealers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that the information clearinghouse improves outcomes for both agro-deale
rs and farmers.
 Clearinghouse treated agro-dealers receive more customers and have higher
 revenues from maize seed than control agro-dealers.
 Clearinghouse treated farmers are significantly more likely to use improved
 maize varieties from agro-dealers, and have higher yields than control
 farmers after two seasons.
 Impact also seems to stem from treated agro-dealers who increase their
 efforts and expand the services that they provide to farmers.
 Treated agro-dealers are also more likely to be registered with the Uganda
 National Agro-input Dealers Association (UNADA), perhaps to signal quality
 now that it has been made salient to farmers.
 Finally, we find that farmers in the treatment group rate maize seed of
 agro-dealers in their neighborhood better, suggesting that the clearinghouse
 treatment is also effective in changing perceptions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The agro-dealer training does not have a clear impact on dealers, nor on
 farmers in associated catchment areas.
 Interestingly, we do find that the information clearinghouse increases
 agro-dealer knowledge about proper seed storage and handling.
 Upon exploring interaction effects between the training and the clearinghouse
 treatment, we also find that the training becomes effective for agro-dealers
 that are also in the clearinghouse treatment group.
 This is consistent with

 show that commuters in Nairobi choose for the safe busses after information

 Second, public disclosure of product information makes it possible for
 sellers to differentiate on quality, and indeed, start competing on it,
 in turn lifting the market out of the low quality equilibrium.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 We suspect that, in addition to the threat of farmers shifting to better

 and a sense of social obligation may even be more important drivers for
 agro-dealers to improve.

The article further fits into an emerging literature that tests how crowd-source

 Even though advances in Information and Communications Technology and the

 there is surprisingly little evidence on the effects of these developments.

We designed an experiment with two interventions (detailed in the next section)
 that aim to induce quality improvements (or perceptions thereof) in the
 seed market, and evaluate their impact on a set of outcomes related to
 market performance, technology adoption, and productivity.
 The interventions are randomized at the agro-dealer catchment area level.
 These catchment areas are clusters of towns, villages, markets, trading
 centers, and other key market sheds where agricultural market activity
 tends to operate, and are typically host to several agro-dealers.
 Clustering agro-dealers into catchment areas is done on the basis of geographic
al location.

 between farmers and agro-dealers in survey data from a previous study of

\begin_layout Standard
We randomize at the level of the catchment area (instead of opting for randomiza
tion at the less aggregate agro-dealer level) for three reasons.
 Firstly, randomizing at the level of the individual agro-dealer prompted
 ethical concerns and was thus ruled out a priori.
 Specifically, in cases where two or more agro-dealers operate in very close
 proximity to each other, treating only one of them may lead to a competitive
 (dis)advantage.
 Randomizing at the catchment level substantially reduces the risk of (dis)advan
taging agro-dealers in this way.
 Secondly, catchment-level randomization reduces the likelihood of spillovers
 from treated to control agro-dealers.
 Thirdly, catchment-level randomization allows us to extend the evaluation
 to the measurement of treatment effects on farmers (and not just agro-dealers)
 because all farmers in the catchment area are now exposed to agro-dealers
 who all received the same treatment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used simulations to determine the sample sizes required to detect effects
 of the treatment on selected outcomes at both farmer and agro-dealer levels.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Simulation provides a flexible and intuitive way to analyze statistical
 power.
 Furthermore, instead of relying on theoretical distributions for the outcome
 variables that make assumptions and return analytic solutions, we run simulatio
ns that (re-)sample from real data that was collected in previous surveys.
 In particular, we use data from 78 agro-dealers and 1,529 smallholder farmers
 in the catchment areas of these agro-dealers that were collected in three
 districts in eastern Uganda in July 2019.
 The data are publicly accessible

\end_inset

 The simulations show that if the number of catchment areas is larger than
 112, our experiments will return statistically significant results 80%
 of the time on a selection of primary outcomes.
 This corresponds to approximately 318 agro-dealers.
 Based on further simulations to study impacts at the farm-household level,
 we decide to collect information on 10 farmers per agro-dealer, leading
 to a sample size of 3,180 households.

To determine the content of the training and to ensure it is sufficiently
 anchored in the study site and context, we consulted experts from several
 Ugandan organizations using semi-structured interviews and a workshop to
 identify problems in the seed sector and in agro-dealer retailing practice,
 and to discuss effective and realistic solutions and best practices to
 address seed storage and handling issues.
 We then developed a training manual to ensure standardization and a simple
 but visually appealing poster illustrating the most important practices.
 Participants in the interviews and workshops included individuals from
 the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industries and Fisheries (MAAIF), the
 National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO) the Uganda Seed Trade
 Association (USTA), and the Uganda National Agro-Dealers Association (UNADA).
 The roll-out of the experiment began in 2021 (Figure

Training
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In each treated catchment area, all agro-dealers were selected for a training,
 and for each treated agro-dealer, both the owner and shop manager were
 invited.
 The owner was invited because several recommended techniques and practices
 required that new investments were made in the agro-dealership, while the
 shop manager was invited because many of the recommendations are hands-on
 practices that would ultimately fall under the manager's purview for day-to-day
 operations.
 Of 166 agro-dealers that were invited, 140 sent at least one person, leading
 to a compliance of 84%.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The trainings took place in May 2021, a time when agro-dealers are not too
 busy, and early enough to ensure they could apply newly learned practices
 in the second agricultural season.
 Trainings were held in locations that were easily reachable by the agro-dealers.
 Trainings were organized in small groups, with an average of 10-15 agro-dealers
 participating.
 To deal with COVID in a responsible manner, participants and trainers were
 required to keep the proper distance, wear face masks, and frequently disinfect
 their hands.
 All attendants were compensated for transport, and both lunch and refreshments
 were provided.
 Participants were further incentivized to engage in the training and pay
 close attention with an offer of a free portable seed moisture meter, subject
 to passing a short content knowledge tests comprised of a short series
 of multiple-choice questions at the end of the training.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This was just to encourage agro-dealers to pay attention.
 Every agro-dealer that attended got a moisture meter, regardless of how
 they scored on the test.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The agro-dealers were also given a copy of an informational poster used
 in the training to remind them of best practices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In each training, the trainers explained correct handling and storage practices
 for improved maize seed and used the poster and an example seed bag for
 illustration.
 Participants then rehearsed the more challenging practices like measuring
 moisture using a moisture meter.
 The trainings were organized and conducted in collaboration with UNADA.

Rating collection and computation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the time of baseline data collection (April 2021), we asked sampled farmers
 to rate all agro-dealers that operated in the catchment area on multiple
 characteristics.
 Enumerators were guided by a tablet-based application that iterated through
 all agro-dealers in the catchment area.
 For each agro-dealer, we provided the common names that are used to refer
 to the agro-dealer, a description of where the store is located, and a
 picture of the store front (obtained during the agro-dealer census—see
 Subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Sample"
plural "false"

\end_inset

).
 If farmers knew the agro-dealer, they were asked to provide ratings using
 the questions listed in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "questions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 For example, we asked farmers to rate the maize seed that an agro-dealer
 sells on a scale of one to five stars on seed germination.
 As can be seen in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "timeline"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 , we implemented the clearinghouse in two consecutive seasons, so ratings
 were collected again in January 2022.
 Ratings were always collected 
\emph on
after
\emph default
 harvest, when smallholders were able to assess seed quality based on observing
 germination and yield, the resistance against droughts, pests and diseases,
 and how quickly the crop matured (i.e., duration).

\begin_layout Standard
A potential concern arises from asking treated farmers to rate agro-dealers
 because it may increase awareness among farmers of the existence of all
 agro-dealers in the area, so that this awareness effect could confound
 the clearinghouse effect.
 To address this concern, we also iterated through the agro-dealers in the
 catchment areas with farmers in the the control group to make them similarly
 aware of the existence of agro-dealers in their vicinity.
 However, control farmers were not asked to rate agro-dealers as the process
 of rating an agro-dealer's seed could make quality more salient, which
 we consider to be a key aspect of the treatment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the answers of all farmers about all agro-dealers in a catchment
 area, we computed an average rating for each agro-dealer.
 These ratings were translated into both words and star ratings to ensure
 that they were easily comprehensible to farmers and agro-dealers when dissemina
ted.
 See Appendix

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Rating dissemination to farmers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our ability to test the effectiveness of the clearinghouse treatment requires
 precise timing for the dissemination of these agro-dealer ratings.
 Dissemination occurred before farmers started buying seed for the next
 agricultural season, allowing treated farmers to use the new rating information
 when choosing whether and where to purchase inputs (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "timeline"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Ratings were disseminated to farmers through short message service (SMS)
 and in person, as detailed below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Text messages
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Farmers were sent one text message per agro-dealer in their proximity by
 SMS in one of three local languages---Lusoga, Lugwere, or Samia---chosen
 at the sub-county level to increase specificity.
 For farmers in the treatment area, the message read: 
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To isolate the effect of the ratings from more general effects that may
 arise from sending SMS messages, we also use a placebo for the control
 group that consisted of an "empty" SMS that only pointed out the existence
 of the agro-dealers in the control farmer's catchment area.
 This also makes it more difficult for farmers to identify if they are being
 treated or not, thus reducing the likelihood of reactivity effects and
 experimenter bias.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
In person
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The enumerators also re-visited the farmers in our sample.
 For this purpose, we designed a visually appealing tablet-based application

 and provides their ratings.
 The application generates the following statement:

The application also displayed the stars associated with the score.
 Again, for control group farmers, the application cycled through the agro-deale
rs in the control areas without providing ratings to control for any effect
 that may arise from simply being reminded of the existence of agro-dealers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Rating dissemination to agro-dealers

Agro-dealers received their ratings by means of a report on laminated paper
 that was delivered to their agro-dealerships.
 The front of the report is a visually appealing certificate with a logo
 and the agro-dealer's general rating (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

The back of the report provides additional information, including the individual
 ratings that the seed sold by the agro-dealer received for overall quality,
 yield, drought and disease resistance, speed of maturing, and germination,
 and the average (combined) ratings of other agro-dealers in the same catchment
 area in a table, visualized by stars.
 This shows agro-dealers their relative position in the area, potentially
 incentivizing the agro-dealer to improve their ratings.
\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The entire process of collecting and disseminating ratings was done twice,
 the first time targeting the second agricultural season of 2021 and the
 second time targeting the first agricultural season of 2022 (see Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "timeline"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Repeating the treatment was important to capture different dynamics of
 particular impact channels on certain outcomes.
 For instance, if seed quality is good but farmers hold pessimistic beliefs
 about the quality, disseminating information may already result in increased
 adoption and yield effects after a single season.
 However, if agro-dealers engage in counterfeiting, the threat of farmers
 switching to more honest agro-dealers may lead them to improve quality,
 which will only be reflected in subsequent ratings.
 This in turn could increase adoption but the effect of this on yields will
 only become apparent during harvest in the second season.
 Repetition may also be important for the effectiveness of certain impact
 pathways.
 For instance, agro-dealers may be more likely to change their behavior
 if they know that they will be scored again in the near future.

\begin_inset Formula $ε_{ij}$

 an error term that is potentially correlated within catchment areas.
 The coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $β$

 is the estimated average treatment effect.
 For farmer-level outcomes, a similar equation is estimated, where

\begin_layout Standard
Because we randomize at the catchment-area level, we use cluster-robust
 variance-covariance matrices that cluster standard errors at this level.
 For outcomes at the farmer level where we have almost 3,500 observations
 in 130 clusters, the original form of the sandwich estimator that does
 not make any small-sample correction, is used.
 For outcomes at the agro-dealer level where we have almost 350 observations
 in 130 clusters, we use the Bell–McCaffrey adjustment

\begin_layout Standard
We also follow several pre-registered principles for variable construction.
 For continuous variables, trimmed values are used to reduce the influence
 of outliers.
 In particular, we trim 1% of each side of the distribution for agro-dealer
 level outcomes and 2.5% of each side of the distribution for farmer level
 outcomes.
 Inverse hyperbolic sine transformations are used if variables are skewed,
 with skewness being defined as the adjusted Fisher-Pearson coefficient
 of skewness exceeding 1.96.
 Outcomes for which 95% of observations have the same value within the relevant
 sample are omitted from the analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We account for multiple hypothesis testing by aggregating different outcomes
 within a family into summary indices, following

Each index is computed as a weighted mean of the standardized values of
 the outcome variables.
 The weights of this efficient generalized least squares estimator are calculate
d to maximize the amount of information captured in the index by giving
 less weight to outcomes that are highly correlated with each other.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 While these indices are useful to answer the question of overall impact
 of the intervention on a family of outcomes, it is not straightforward
 to interpret the effect size.
 Zooming in on individual outcomes within each family, effect sizes become
 more meaningful and show which variables drive the results.
 That is why we also report the treatment effects on individual variables,
 though we advise care in interpretation.

 This procedure led to an average of three agro-dealers per catchment area,
 ranging from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 18.

To connect agro-dealers to customers, we asked agro-dealers for the names
 of the villages where most of their customers come from.
 Then enumerators were instructed to randomly sample ten households that
 grow maize in these villages.
 Consequently, about 3,500 smallholder maize farmers were sampled.

\begin_layout Standard
At the level of the agro-dealer, enumerators were instructed to interview
 the person who is most knowledgeable about the day-to-day operations, which
 was usually the shop manager.
 As part of this initial quality assessment process, a bag of maize seed
 was also purchased at each agro-dealer, although only 232 of the 348 sampled
 agro-dealers had seed in stock at the time of the baseline interview.
 Enumerators were also instructed to note down a series of objectively verifiabl

 Often, this also meant that enumerators inspected stores at different locations
 that were separate from the sales outlet.

 However, a set of questions deals with the household head, who could be

 was asked to enumerate all maize plots, from which a random plot was chosen,
 and detailed data was collected on that plot.

.
 The average respondent is 32 years old; 60% are male and more than 90%
 finished primary education.
 In 55% of the cases, the respondent is also the owner of the agro-dealership.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We see substantial heterogeneity among agro-dealers.
 Some are small informal stores that are located in rural areas and sell
 maize seed and other agricultural inputs in addition to consumer items
 to a small customer base and only during the planting season.
 Others have many customers, are located in towns and only sell inputs and
 equipment used in agricultural production.
 The average agro-dealership was established 5 years prior to the baseline
 survey date, is located 7 km from the nearest tarmac road, and services
 an average of 41 customers per day.
 Among the sampled agro-dealers, 74% only sell farm inputs and equipment.
 60% reported that they provide credit and 46% that they offer advisory
 services.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Information was also collected to provide an initial assessment of the quality
 of maize seed sold at the sampled agro-dealers.
 This included specific questions on seed storage and handling.
 Furthermore, with the shop manager's permission, enumerators—drawing on
 training provided to them at the outset of the study—inspected the area
 where seed was stored and noted the conditions.
 We find that 65% of agro-dealers had problems with pests such as rats or
 insects, while 16% store maize seed in open containers, thus exposing the
 seed to a range of pests and contaminants.
 Not surprisingly two thirds of the agro-dealers sampled reported that they
 had received at least one complaint about seed they sold from a customer
 during the prior season.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Turning to the seed samples obtained from the agro-dealers, our measurements
 of moisture content in the bag indicated an average of 13.6%, with a minimum
 of 10.3% and a maximum of 17.4%.
 On average, these moisture rates were above the recommended rate of 13%,
 suggesting potential for the growth of molds and storage pests that can
 negatively affect seed quality and performance.

 In terms of labeling for quality, 68% of the purchased seed bags contained
 a printed packaging date, only 18% had an expiry date, and only 8% displayed
 a quality indication label issued by the National Seed Certification Services
 (NSCS).

Typically, maize seed is certified by NSCS, a division of the Department
 of Crop Inspection and Certification (DCIC) in MAAIF.
 Certified seed is indicated as such with a blue tag or sticker affixed
 to the package, and quality declared seed is indicated by a green tag or
 sticker.

 The average household head in our sample is 49 years old; 78% are male
 and 51% have finished primary education.
 The average household size is 9 people, and the typical homestead is located
 4 kilometers from the nearest agro-dealer and 9 kilometers from the nearest
 tarmac road.
 The average farmer has 23 years of experience with maize cultivation and
 cultivates 3 acres of land for all crop including maize.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Half of the farmers in our sample planted improved maize seed on at least
 one of their plots during last season, with 1 out of 3 farmers purchasing
 this seed at an agro-dealer.
 Only 25% applied inorganic fertilizers such as di-ammonium phosphate (DAP)
 or nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) on the randomly selected plot.
 Yields on these plots in the season preceding the baseline survey (the
 August-December 2020 season) was about 440 kilograms per acre.

\begin_layout Standard
We include standard orthogonality tables with pre-registered variables for
 both agro-dealers and farmers to test if treatment and control groups are
 comparable in terms of a set of baseline characteristics (Tables 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 respectively).
 Some of these characteristics are unlikely to be affected by the intervention,
 while others are drawn from the set of outcome variables that will be used
 to measure the intervention's impact and explore the underlying mechanisms
 at play in the next sections.

\begin_layout Standard
For outcomes at the agro-dealer level reported in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "balance_dealer"

caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we find that from a total of 32 comparisons, only one is significant at
 the 5% significance level and two are significant at the 10% level.
 For outcomes at the farmer level reported in (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, out of 32 comparisons, one is significant at the 10% level.

 reports attrition levels in the treatment and comparison groups.
 We failed to collect data from 12% of agro-dealers and 2% of farmers at
 midline, and from 14% of agro-dealers and 1% of farmers at endline.
 To test if non-response is related to one of the treatments, we regress
 the likelihood of leaving the sample on the treatment indicators.
 We find that clearinghouse treated agro-dealers are significantly less
 likely to leave the sample.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The differential attrition may be due to a larger share of control agro-dealers
 going out of business, while the clearinghouse treatment cushioned some
 agro-dealers in the treatment catchment areas against bankruptcy at a time
 when COVID-19 hit.
 As in biomedical RCTs where differential attrition rates may be due to
 excess mortality in the control group, the attritors are likely the ones
 that would have benefited most from the treatment.
 As such, the unadjusted selection-contaminated estimates provide lower
 bounds for the true treatment effect

The presentation of results in this paper differs somewhat from the way
 it was pre-registered and presented in the mock report (and midline report,
 endline report, and previous versions of this manuscript).
 In particular, we reorganized the presentation of the results to match
 a structure where we first look at impact on outcomes at the end of the
 causal chain and then look at impact on intermediate outcomes to explore
 potential mechanisms.
 While this change does affect the construction of some of the indices,
 overall conclusions remain the same.
 Several pre-registered tables can be found in Appendix

Impact on agro-dealers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start by testing if the interventions affected general business operations
 of agro-dealers (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Effects on dealer outcomes at end of causal chain: Business volume"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Sales volume and price, revenue, and number of customers and maize varieties
 in stock are the key outcomes of interest.
 A measure of sales volume was constructed by asking agro-dealers how much
 of a specific maize variety they sold in the previous season.
 We restrict attention to the four most popular improved varieties, two
 of which are hybrids (Longe 7H and Longe 10H) and two of which are open
 pollinated varieties (OPVs) (Longe 4 and Longe 5).
 Total quantity sold is the sum of quantities sold of these four varieties.
 We also asked agro-dealers about the sales price of the four varieties
 at the start of the season and then calculated the simple average at the
 agro-dealer level.
 We then calculate the revenue (expressed in million UGX) by first multiplying
 prices with quantities sold and then summing over the four varieties.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
One dollar was about 3600 UGX at the time of the study.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We also include the number of customers that bought maize seed on an average
 day at the start of the season, as well as the number of maize varieties
 that the agro-dealer had in stock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Effects on dealer outcomes at end of causal chain: Business volume"

\end_inset

 shows that we do not find an impact of training agro-dealers on their business
 operations.
 At both midline and endline, the impact on the index is not significantly
 different from zero.
 No particular pattern emerges to explain these insignificant results, and
 there is little significance among any of the outcome variables when estimated
 separately.
 At midline, we find a negative impact of the training on the average sales
 price.
 At endline, the training seems to have reduced amounts sold, which is also
 reflected in a lower revenue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We do find a positive impact of the information clearinghouse intervention
 on agro-dealer operations.
 At midline, the overall index is significantly higher among agro-dealers
 in the clearinghouse treatment group.
 Among individual outcomes, treated agro-dealers sold more maize seed at
 a higher price, albeit not significantly so.
 However, in combination, this lead to revenues that are almost 20% higher
 (and this difference is significant at the 10% level).

\end_inset

 At endline, the positive effect of the clearinghouse intervention seems
 to become stronger, with the overall index now significant at the 1% level.
 The effect is driven by a 31% increase in the number of customers that
 a treated agro-dealer attracts, which translates into 6 additional customers
 per day.

, we also include outcomes related to stock management, given that seed
 quality decreases with shelf-life.
 We asked the agro-dealers how much of the particular seed was carried over
 from the previous season.
 Many agro-dealers reported that they did not carry over any seed, leading
 to low baseline means.
 Furthermore, we asked the agro-dealers to estimate how much they bought
 from any provider during the same season.
 For both varieties, this is slightly more than what agro-dealers reported
 to have sold.
 We expect our treatments to decrease the amount of seed carried forward
 and increase the amount of fresh seed procured from providers.
 We also asked the agro-dealers to estimate how much of the seed stock was
 lost or wasted during the season, and how often they ran out of stock.
 We expect the interventions to reduce both losses and stock-outs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For both varieties, we do not find significant effects of the training nor
 the clearinghouse treatment at midline.
 At endline however, all individual coefficient estimates move in the expected
 direction for the information clearinghouse, and when outcomes are combined
 in an index, the effect is positive and statistically significant.

\begin_layout Standard
Moving one step further up the impact chain, we explore whether reported
 increases in the number of customers, sales, and revenues are likely driven
 by an increase in the quality of maize seed sold by these agro-dealers.
 To do so, we instructed enumerators to buy a random bag of seed from each
 agro-dealer.
 This bag was then inspected on a range of attributes (bag integrity, lot
 number, packaging date, and shelf-life, etc) and moisture was measured.
 Our quality tests of the seed purchased and collected during the survey
 did not indicate any effects, although due to the fact that not all agro-dealer
s had seed in stock, we may be facing statistical power issues.
 More information can be found in Appendix

We first examine harvest-related outcomes for farmers and report the results
 in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Effects on farmer outcomes at end of causal chain: Harvest"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 We start by examining production, plot size, and production scaled by plot
 size (i.e., yield) on a randomly selected maize plot.
 We also look at market participation (amount sold, sales price, and revenue
 from maize sales) and how much grain farmers save to use as seed in the
 next season.
 While we expect positive effects on harvest and sales, the amount kept
 as seed enters the index negatively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The coefficient estimates for the overall index show no effect of the agro-deale
r training, and a positive effect of the information clearinghouse, albeit
 only after two seasons of implementation.
 Farmers that live in areas where the clearinghouse was implemented report
 higher production and productivity at endline than control farmers that
 live areas where the clearinghouse was not implemented.
 Yield differences are significant at the 1% level and amount to 10% of
 the baseline mean.
 Finally, we look at the amount of maize that farmers retain for seed in
 the next season.
 At midline, we see that, in line with expectations, clearinghouse treated
 farmers save less grain for seed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To further explore the large and significant effect of the clearinghouse
 on yields, we investigate whether specific subgroups of farmers experienced
 yield gains more than others.
 Rerunning the regression only for farmers who did not adopt at baseline
 led to a coefficient of 56.44 with a standard error of 17.38 (hence, significance
 at the 1% level).
 For farmers that did adopt at baseline, we find a coefficient of 30.79 with
 a standard error of 20.38 (hence, no significance).
 This indicates that the effect is plausibly driven by farmers who did not
 use improved maize seed at baseline, started using improved maize seed
 due to the clearinghouse and, in turn, realized higher yields.

\begin_layout Standard
Moving up on the causal chain, we test if the interventions affect the use
 of agricultural technology by farmers.
 In particular, we examine the use of purchased maize seed as a second important
 family of outcomes at the smallholder level.
 For the agro-dealer training, we do not find any effect at midline, nor
 at endline.
 The effect of the information clearinghouse treatment on overall use (or
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

adoption
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for convenience) as measured by the index is positive and significant at
 the 5% level at mid- and endline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zooming in on individual outcomes, we start with a subjective assessment
 of seed used by asking farmers if they "...used any quality maize seed (like
 OPV or hybrid in seed) on any of their plots".
 We see that at midline, farmers that were subjected to the clearinghouse
 treatment were 3.5 percentage points more likely to answer this question
 with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 than control farmers.
 After two agricultural seasons, the difference between treatment and control
 farmers increases to 4.2 percentage points.
 Related, we ask if farmers bought high-yielding maize varieties at an agro-deal
er for any plot.
 At midline, we find a difference between the clearinghouse treatment and
 control groups of about 6 percentage points, and this amounts to an almost
 20% increase relative to the baseline mean.
 At endline, the difference is about 3 percentage points, but not significant.
 We do not find an impact of the clearinghouse on the amount of seed that
 farmers bought at agro-dealers.
 However, note that estimates are based on a small sample size (n=599 at
 midline and 621 at endline) that was conditional on having purchased seed
 from an agro-dealer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we turn our attention to the use of purchased maize seed on a randomly
 selected plot.
 For the use of seed from either hybrid or open-pollinated maize varieties,
 we find positive treatment effects of the clearinghouse, although the coefficie
nts are insignificant.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Here, we asked farmers which variety they planted in the previous season.
 If a farmer used Longe 10H, Longe 7H, Longe 7R/Kayongo-go, Bazooka, Longe
 6H, Longe 5/Nalongo, Longe 4, Panner, Wema, KH series, or other hybrid/OPV,
 and this seed was not recycled or farmer-saved but newly purchased, it
 counted as hybrid/open-pollinated maize seed.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 As for the more general questions above, we also ask if the seed that was
 used on the random plot was obtained from an agro-dealer.
 We find an almost 5 percentage point treatment effect for the clearinghouse
 at midline and an almost 4 percentage point effect at endline.
 Conversely, we estimate the clearinghouse effect on the use of farmer-saved
 seed on the randomly selected plot.
 Again—and in line with our expectations—we find that farmers that were
 exposed to the clearinghouse treatment reduced their use of saved seed,
 albeit only significantly so at midline.
 Finally, we examine the product of the amount and the price of maize seed,
 i.e., the total expenditure on seed for the plot.
 We see that in areas where the clearinghouse was implemented, farmers invest
 significantly more in seed.

\begin_layout Standard
For the agro-dealer training, the underlying mechanism is fairly straightforward
: it potentially changes agro-dealer knowledge and behavior through learning,
 which results from exposure to, and uptake of, new and salient information.
 The information clearinghouse is a multifarious intervention in that it
 solves a variety of potentially interlinked information problems simultaneously.
 If the quality of maize seed is sufficient but some farmers believe that
 agro-dealers provide sub-standard quality, a clearinghouse may correct
 their perceptions.
 If the quality of seed differs between agro-dealers, the clearinghouse
 provides farmers with information that may help them to switch to agro-dealers
 selling better quality products.
 Furthermore, the rating system directly incentivizes agro-dealers to stay
 ahead of immediate competitors.
 They can do this by improving the quality of the products they offer, or
 by signaling that the quality of products they offer is good.
 In this section, we investigate the relative importance of these different
 impact pathways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Agro-dealer knowledge
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary mechanism underlying the agro-dealer training is learning, which
 is in turn expected to increase knowledge of treated agro-dealers.
 To test if the interventions affect agro-dealer knowledge, we construct
 two indices that summarize different measures of knowledge.
 The first index aims to measure knowledge about seed storage and handling
 and tests if agro-dealers retained the information that was provided during
 the training.
 The test is a short multiple choice quiz of five questions related to seed
 carryover between agricultural seasons, how seed should be stored after
 repackaging, how seed should be stored in the storeroom, and whether seed
 should be repackaged.
 The exact questions, the options presented to farmers, and the correct
 answers are outlined in Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "A.4 Multiple choice questions to measure dealer knowledge"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second knowledge index aims to capture knowledge about seed more broadly,
 and does not focus on seed handling recommendations covered in the training.
 We again use multiple choice questions to test if agro-dealers know which
 seed variety to recommend if a farmer complains about poor soil or lack
 of rain, if a farmer is late for planting, and whether they know what to
 tell clients who inquire about the yield benefits of hybrid or OPV seed.
 Again, the questions and (correct) answer options are explained in Appendix
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "A.4 Multiple choice questions to measure dealer knowledge"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As these knowledge indices generally mask how much agro-dealers knew at
 baseline, we provide baseline means and effects on all individual knowledge
 variables in Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "A.5 Effect on agro-dealer knowledge - Individual variables"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Baseline knowledge is low with only 5% of agro-dealers knowing which variety
 to recommend if a farmer complains about little rain.
 They perform best when asked about repackaging seed: 64% of agro-dealers
 know that this practice should be avoided.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Effects on dealer knowledge"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 suggests a positive impact of the agro-dealer training on knowledge at
 midline, but the coefficient is just shy of significance at the 10% level.
 The (insignificant) effect of the training is strongest at midline, which
 seems reasonable as the training was organized only once at the start of
 the study (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "timeline"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Interestingly, we find knowledge effects from the clearinghouse treatment,
 particularly for agro-dealer knowledge related to seed storage seed and
 handling.
 This effect becomes stronger over time, which again seems reasonable as
 this treatment was repeated.
 This result suggests that the clearinghouse treatment, with its focus on
 seed quality, prompts agro-dealers to actively search for information on
 better ways to store and handle seed.

 In our setting, extra knowledge at the agro-dealer level is only useful
 if farmers are able to appreciate the effect of it (see also 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 To examine this further, we exploit the factorial design of the experiment,
 and focus on the subset of agro-dealers that were assigned to both the
 training and the clearinghouse treatment.
 We indeed find a significant positive interaction effect on key outcomes
 at the agro-dealer level at endline (most notably on the overall operations
 index, as in Table

 The positive interaction effect seems to be driven by significant improvements
 in effort and practices (as in Table

 We also find a positive interaction effect on the index of agro-dealer
 knowledge about seed at midline, but the effect is not significant, possibly
 due to insufficient statistical power to test interactions.
 Results on these interaction effects are available from the authors upon

Agro-dealers can attempt to increase quality by changing the way they store
 and handle seed.
 Furthermore, and particularly if they already use appropriate storage and
 handling methods, they may increase effort and start providing more or
 better services in an attempt to (indirectly) affect ratings.

For example, if agro-dealers already provide quality inputs but farmers
 complain about low yields, agro-dealers may provide training/advice and
 recommend complementary inputs to get optimal results.
 This could increase yields, in turn increasing farmer perceptions of seed
 quality.
 Or, agro-dealers may provide insurance or cash back guarantees, which may
 then be interpreted by farmers as a signal that agro-dealers sell high
 quality.

In Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, we provide evidence that agro-dealers who are exposed to the clearinghouse
 indeed invest more effort than agro-dealers in the control group.
 The table shows results for one overall index and four individual indices
 that each capture different dimensions of effort, services, and practices.
 The first index focuses on effort and service provision as reported by
 agro-dealers themselves, and is composed of seven variables: whether the
 agro-dealer (1) offers explanations on how to use the seed they sell to
 farmers, (2) recommends complementary inputs to get optimal results from
 improved varieties, (3) provides advisory services or training, (4) offers
 discounts for large-quantity purchases, (5) offers credit, (6) received
 a seed-related customer complaint since last season, and (7) accepts mobile
 money payments.
 A second index summarizes the perceptions of farmers who purchase from
 these agro-dealers.
 This index is also constructed from seven variables: whether a agro-dealer
 (1) offers refunds or insurance, (2) provides credit, (3) offers training
 or advice to customers, (4) delivers to the farmgate, (5) provides after-sales
 service, (6) accepts different payment methods, and (7) sells small quantities.
 Farmers' answers to these questions are aggregated at the agro-dealer level
 before the index is computed.

\begin_layout Standard
To handle and store seed correctly, a combination of investments and labor-inten
sive practices are necessary.
 Also during the agro-dealer training, we recommended a mix of practices
 that are in reach of different types of agro-dealers, some of which may
 have excess labor while others may have access to money to invest.
 A third index groups a set of labor-intensive seed handling and storage
 practices.
 It contains six variables: whether seed is stored (1) in a dedicated area,
 (2) in correct lighting, (3) on appropriate surfaces, and (4) not in open
 containers; whether the agro-dealer has a pest problem; and whether the
 agro-dealership looks clean and professional.
 Data for these variables were collected by enumerators through visual inspectio
n, and none are self-reported by agro-dealers.
 A fourth index summarizes capital-intensive seed-handling practices, based
 on six variables: whether the roof is (1) leak-proof, (2) insulated; (3)
 whether the walls are insulated; whether the agro-dealership is (4) ventilated,
 and (5) displays any official certificate; and (6) whether expired seed
 is handled correctly.
 Most of these variables were collected or at least confirmed by enumerators
 through visual inspection, only one of them (whether expired seed is handled
 correctly) is self-reported.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To test whether social desirability affects this result, we exclude the
 last variable from the index and rerun the analysis, since agro-dealers
 might report that they handle expired seed correctly but, in reality, choose
 not to do so for strategic reasons such as cost management.
 Doing this does not change the coefficients for the index of capital-intensive
 seed-handling practices in any notable way.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that the clearinghouse intervention increases agro-dealer effort
 and services, especially at midline, where the coefficient of the overall
 index is significant at the 1% level.
 This effect is driven by treated agro-dealers who significantly raised
 their effort and services, according to farmers.
 We see that the impact persists until endline, where the significant effect
 on the overall index seems to be driven by the self-reported measure of
 effort.
 We do not find that the agro-dealer training improves services or practices.

.
 In our case, as it is difficult to assess seed quality via visual inspection,
 agro-dealers may use various strategies to signal to customers that their
 products are of good quality.
 Becoming a member of professional organizations is one way to do so, as
 these memberships signal professionalism.
 Agro-dealers who try to signal quality will also not shy away from inspections.
 On the contrary, they may actively seek inspection so that they can advertise
 the result in their agro-dealerships.

 collects a set of variables related to signaling quality, including memberships
 in UNADA and other professional associations, trading licenses, the number
 of inspections in the last season, and warnings or confiscations of seed
 after inspection.
 We find that at endline, judging by the overall index, the clearinghouse
 treatment led to a significant increase in compliance with or participation
 in quality assurance measures.
 Looking at the individual outcomes, the overall effect seems to be driven
 by an increase in registrations with UNADA.
 We also see that treated agro-dealers were inspected significantly more
 often.

Switching
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important potential mechanism underlying the effect of the information
 clearinghouse at the farmer level is the possibility that farmers switch
 from lower rated agro-dealers to those with better ratings.
 To explore this mechanism, we asked farmers if they switched agro-dealers
 since the previous season.
 Results (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "switchingfarmers"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) indicate that only 17% of farmers reported switching at baseline.
 However, at midline, a significantly higher share of farmers in the clearinghou
se treatment group reported switching agro-dealers.
 Also at endline, we find a higher propensity for switching among clearinghouse
 treated farmers.

\begin_layout Standard
Increased switching in itself does not necessarily mean that farmers move
 from lower-rated agro-dealers to higher-rated ones.
 To investigate this, we calculate the difference between the rating of
 agro-dealer the farmer is switching to and that of the agro-dealer the
 farmer is switching from.
 If farmers move to better-rated agro-dealers, this difference is positive.
 We find that this is indeed the case, and more so during the second season,
 although the difference is not significantly different from zero at conventiona
l levels (p-value = 0.166).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the agro-dealer level, we find that the clearinghouse treatment led to
 a significant increase in the number of customers (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Effects on dealer outcomes at end of causal chain: Business volume"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 This can not be explained by farmers switching, since switching involves
 an increase in customers for some agro-dealers at the expense of others,
 leaving the average number of customers of agro-dealers in the treatment
 group unaffected.
 When we look at changes in customers over time, we actually do not see
 that the increase in customers is largest for agro-dealers with high ratings.
 This suggests that the impact of the clearinghouse treatment on perceptions—to
 which we turn next—may be particularly important for agro-dealers with
 low ratings, offsetting any potential loss that is due to the switching
 mechanism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Perceptions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the clearinghouse may change farmer perceptions of the quality
 of seed sold by agro-dealers.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Effects of clearinghouse on farmer perceptions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 provides impact on two measures of farmer perceptions of quality.
 First, we asked farmers if they think that maize seed that can be bought
 at agro-dealers is counterfeit or adulterated.
 At baseline, two in three farmers responded affirmatively to this question,
 indicating substantial pessimism about quality.
 Columns (2) to (5) show the impact of the clearinghouse for the full sample.
 The treatment does not significantly affect farmer perceptions as measured
 by this variable at midline or endline.
 However, we expect the effect of the clearinghouse on perceptions to be
 strongest for farmers who did not use improved maize varieties at baseline.
 Therefore, we repeat the analysis for this subgroup of farmers in columns
 (6) to (9).
 At midline, farmers that did not adopt at baseline and live in areas exposed
 to the clearinghouse are 12.5 percentage points less likely to think that
 agro-dealers sell adulterated seed than similar farmers in areas not assigned
 to the treatment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, we look at rating data to assess farmer perceptions of product quality.
 In particular, we look at the index of maize seed ratings that combine
 ratings for general quality, yield, drought tolerance, pest and disease
 tolerance, time of maturity, and germination of seed obtained from various
 agro-dealers.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As the act of rating agro-dealers was an essential part of the clearinghouse
 treatment, we only collect ratings in control areas at endline and so can
 only test this hypothesis at endline.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 These ratings are aggregated at the farmer level (since one farmer generally
 rates multiple agro-dealers) and then the index is calculated.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To compute this index at the farmer level, we restrict the sample to observation
s where a farmer needs to have rated at least one agro-dealer in the catchment
 area on all components of the index.
 This procedure leads to a sample size reduction, which in turn may affect
 statistical power.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We see that the index is positively and significantly affected by the clearingh
ouse treatment, even though the effect is only significant at the 10% level.
 If we restrict the sample to farmers that did not adopt improved maize
 varieties at baseline, the treatment effect on the ratings is significant
 at the 5% level.
 The impact on the overall index that combines the two perception related
 indicators is also significant for this sub-sample.

$^1$The index of farmer's maize seed ratings contains 6 ratings: general
 quality, yield, drought tolerance, pest/disease tolerance, time of maturity,
 germination.
 The ratings are aggregated at farmer level (one farmer rates multiple agro-deal
ers), then the index is computed.
 Note that treatment and control groups can only be compared at endline.
 At base- and midline, only clearinghouse treated farmers rated dealers
 in their proximity because being confronted with these questions is part
 of the treatment.
 Hence control dealers were not rated and this line is left blank at midline.
 At endline, all farmers rated all agro-dealers, so that this variable can
 be investigated.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The improvement in farmer opinions and ratings may reflect a real increase
 in the quality of seed, because the clearinghouse improved agro-dealers'
 seed handling efforts and practices, thus improving seed quality.
 However, in Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "seed_quality"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 we show that we do not find clear evidence that the clearinghouse treatment
 affected a set of (imperfect) quality proxies of the seed the agro-dealer
 sell.
 Furthermore, looking at Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Effects on dealer efforts"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we find no evidence that agro-dealers change seed handling practices in
 response to the clearinghouse treatment.
 As such, it does not seem that the change in perceptions reflects a real
 change in quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An alternative explanation is that the quality of maize seed at most agro-dealer
s in our sample is sufficient but (non-adopting) farmers misperceive it.
 This is in line with 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "MICHELSON2021102579"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "wossen2022misperceiving"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 who establish that input quality is generally good but that farmers’ beliefs
 are often incorrect, so that one simply needs to rectify this misperception
 to increase adoption.
 Consistent with this explanation, we find that two in three farmers thought
 that maize seed at agro-dealers is counterfeit or adulterated at baseline.
 At the same time, note that the average agro-dealer was rated 3.4 out of
 5 at baseline which indicates that perceived seed quality was reasonable.
 The fact that ratings are relatively high is probably due to the fact that
 farmers who rate have experience with seed from agro-dealers.
 Because of the clearinghouse treatment, mostly non-adopting pessimistic
 farmers notice that adopting peers do not share their pessimism, and they
 adjust their perceptions.
 Furthermore, the clearinghouse affects several measures of adoption already
 at midline.
 If we assume that changing agro-dealer behavior and farmers noticing this
 change takes some time, rectifying incorrect perceptions of smallholders
 must have played an important role in increasing their adoption.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "section: Conclusion"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, we hypothesize that seed quality deteriorates because agro-dealer
s lack knowledge and/or because asymmetric information results in excessive
 search costs for farmers and reduced incentives for agro-dealers.
 Our hypothesized solutions to these problems are a training to inform agro-deal
ers about correct seed handling and storage practices, and an information
 clearinghouse based on crowd-sourced ratings of the quality of seed that
 agro-dealers sell to farmers.
 We explore the impact of these solutions on a range of agro-dealer and
 farmer outcomes with an experimental design that allows for causal attribution
 and investigation of several underlying mechanisms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results show that training agro-dealers is generally ineffective: our training
 does not change agro-dealer knowledge about proper storage and handling
 practices, their day-to-day operations, or the seed they sell to farmers.
 Nor does the training affect farmers' perceptions of seed quality purchased
 from these agro-dealers or subsequent use of purchased seed.
 The punchline from these results is that training seems insufficient without
 additional incentives.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is where the clearinghouse results come into play.
 They suggest that if agro-dealers have the right incentives, they may actively
 seek out knowledge necessary to improve their operations and stay ahead
 of their competitors.
 If agro-dealers are exposed to both incentives and information, they handle
 and store seed better and attract more business.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recently, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "dar2020private"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 showed that an information intervention targeted at private input suppliers
 is effective in changing their behavior and in increasing farmer-level
 adoption, which seems to contradict our null result for the training at
 first sight.
 However, their information treatment is very different from ours: instead
 of training these suppliers in seed handling and storage at the agro-input
 shop, they give them access to a new seed variety for their own learning,
 hoping that they will spread this information to their clients who will
 use it on the farm.
 Moreover, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "dar2020private"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 find that business incentives and reputational concerns play a key role
 when dealers share information and give advice, which is in line with our
 finding that incentives matter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The information clearinghouse clearly affected the market for maize seed
 in our study area: sellers and buyers started behaving in line with our
 theory of change.
 Agro-dealers reported more business and smallholders reported increased
 use of purchased maize varieties, in turn increasing production outcomes.
 This effect seems to partly originate from agro-dealers who expanded service
 provision and signal quality to farmers to outperform their competitors.
 We find some evidence that the clearinghouse induced farmers to switch
 between agro-agro-dealers, but most of the impact on farmer outcomes seems
 to be driven by the fact that the clearinghouse improved the opinions that
 farmers held about agro-dealers and their products.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The significant impact of the clearinghouse indicates that farmers cannot
 judge the quality of maize seed at the time of purchase.
 If the quality of a product can not be easily assessed at the time of purchase,
 one solution is to make sure consumers do not have to, through regulation
 and quality assurance.
 Most LMICs regulate seed quality in the formal market with codified standards,
 inspections, and certification systems.
 However, and particularly in countries that lack institutional capacity
 to implement and enforce the regulatory framework, the reach of these quality
 assurance systems—and the seed market in general—is limited.
 As a result, seed certification provides farmers with a relatively weak
 and unreliable indication of quality.
 A decentralized approach that relies on crowd-sourced quality signals such
 as the clearinghouse may be more effective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, peer ratings are likely to measure the dimensions of seed quality
 that matter most to smallholders.
 While it is possible to objectively measure seed quality (e.g., by sending
 mystery shoppers, followed by DNA fingerprinting) or agro-dealer practices
 (e.g., by sending objective inspectors incognito), it is plausible that farmers
 are not concerned about genetic purity (indicating whether the seed embodies
 the genetic characteristics of a specific variety) but mainly care about
 seed performance (e.g., germination rate, vigor, and yield).
 The opinion of peers who are familiar with the heterogeneous conditions
 farmers face, may be more useful and trustworthy for smallholders than
 the judgment of an inspector or DNA test.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A key assumption underlying the clearinghouse mechanisms is that, while
 individual farmers can not assess the quality of seed at the time of purchase,
 collective experience does provide useful information.
 This is because farmers can learn from experience, and use this information
 when making decisions in subsequent seasons.
 Empirically, however, farmers may have difficulties drawing a causal link
 between seed quality, on the one hand, and plant emergence, growth, and
 harvest, on the other hand given the extensive set of confounding variables
 at play (rainfall, soil quality, pest and disease pressure, inputs, management,
 and plant genetics), the complexity of genotype-by-environment-by management
 (G×E×M) interactions, or the stochastic nature of many of these variables.
 In addition, Bayesian learning takes time, and opportunities to learn are
 few (even tough in Uganda there are two agricultural seasons).
 This partly explains the rich body of research on the role of peer effects
 in technology adoption: the ability to combine own experience with the
 experience of farmers in a similar location is therefore likely to provide
 a good signal about the quality of seed 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "10.1257/aer.100.1.35,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0297.2006.01115.x,foster1995learning"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 As farmers are thus unlikely to discover quality of inputs themselves,
 an information clearinghouse that relies on peer ratings is expected to
 increase data points that farmers can use when making adoption decisions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the crowd-sourced information clearinghouse tested in this study may
 also be feasible at scale, the clearinghouse idea cannot not be approached
 naively.
 There is considerable controversy surrounding the credibility of reviewing
 platforms and the ability of sellers on these platforms to improve their
 ratings with payments to consumers to provide favorable ratings, automated
 bot reviews, and other strategic practices.
 There are also more practical considerations, such as how long ratings
 should remain valid, or how to deal with sellers who receive high ratings
 on one set of attributes—seed quality, in this case—but perform poorly
 in other categories, for example, by engaging in unfair labor practices,
 discriminating against certain types of customers, engaging in anti-competitive
 behavior, or promoting environmentally hazardous products.
 Rating platforms could potentially amplify these practices and biases rather
 than address them.
 While this paper offers both proof of concept and an empirical test of
 theoretical predictions about the relationship between observable product
 quality and buyer and seller behavior in a market characterized by asymmetric
 information, further piloting and testing is needed at increasingly larger
 scales to test additional hypotheses about market performance, supply and
 demand responses, and productivity, welfare, and resilience outcomes.

Effects on seed quality at agro-dealer
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To assess the effect of the training and clearinghouse intervention on the
 quality of seed sold by agro-dealers, we bought a bag of seed at each agro-deal
er and inspected it on a number of attributes.
 First, we measured the moisture content of the seed.
 In Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Effects on bag of maize seed bought at dealer"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we see that the clearinghouse treatment reduced moisture as expected,
 but the parameter is estimated imprecisely, perhaps due to the smaller
 data set as we were not able to source seed from all agro-dealers and the
 comparisons were only made for agro-dealers from which the enumerator was
 able to buy a bag of maize seed at mid- or endline.
 We further look at the integrity of the package and whether it shows important
 information such as the packaging date, shelf-life and the lot number.
 We do not find that the clearinghouse treatment nor the agro-dealer training
 affected quality proxies of the seed that agro-dealers sell.
 However, because our proxies of seed quality are far from perfect and we
 rely on a smaller sample, we cannot safely conclude that the treatments
 did not affect seed quality.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Assessing seed quality is not only challenging for farmers, but also for
 researchers.
 Even though investigating moisture is an attempt to test the quality of
 seeds in a quantitative and objective way, this variable is one-dimensional
 and only a weak indication of seed quality.
 Additional ways to capture seed quality include lab testing to measure
 purity as the rate of extraneous, non-seed material in the bag, germination
 using a germination chamber, grow-out tests for genetic purity using morphologi
cal analysis, and DNA fingerprinting to test for genetic purity using single
 nucleotide polymorphisms tests.

$^2$The comparisons were only made for agro-dealers in which the enumerator
 was able to buy a bag of maize seed at mid- or endline.
 Also, we do not control for the baseline values of the outcome variables
 in the entire table because only 144 of the 179 dealers who had seed at
 midline also had seed at baseline and only 183 of the 265 dealers who had
 seed at endline also had seed at baseline, so that controlling for baseline
 values would reduce the sample sizes drastically.

\begin_layout Paragraph*
What to do if a treated dealer does not receive a single rating?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a shop in a treated catchment area is not rated by a single farmer, e.g.,
 because no farmer in our sample knows him or her, we could fill in the
 catchment area mean as his or her rating.
 However, this is not as innocent as it seems because it is likely that
 the lack of ratings is not random.
 Poor quality dealers have less customers, so their likelihood to get rated
 is lower.
 Giving them average catchment area ratings inflates the ratings of these
 low quality dealers.
 Instead, we simply told farmers that we do not have information about this
 shop (implicitly informing the farmer that it exists).
 16 of 193 treated dealers were not rated by a single farmer in the first
 round.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Should more ratings lead to better ratings?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some agro-dealers were not rated by any smallholder in the first round,
 while others were rated by up to 22 smallholders.
 If dealer A is rated by 10 farmers and gets rating 3,5 and dealer B is
 rated by 1 farmer and gets rating 3,6, we treat dealer B as the better
 dealer.
 Even though receiving many (few) ratings can be related to good (poor)
 quality (the lack of ratings could be nonrandom, see previous paragraph),
 there could be other reasons why dealers are rated by many (few) farmers.
 Furthermore, giving higher ratings to better-known dealers could harm new
 dealers entering the market and dealers who are discriminated, e.g., due
 to their gender.
 Also on TripAdvisor, having more reviews than a rival hotel does not lead
 to a better rating.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Should ratings depend on catchment area dealer performance?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following examples show that ratings should not depend on catchment
 area averages.
 In an area with poor quality dealers in which one dealer is a bit better
 than the rest but still poor, we do not want this dealer to be rated well
 (i.e., expose farmers to poor quality dealers).
 Similarly, in an area with good dealers in which one dealer is a bit worse
 than the rest but still good, we do not want this dealer to be rated poorly
 (which would be unfair towards him or her).
 On the other hand, less than 9% of agro-dealers received a rating below
 3 out of 5, so we would throw away valuable data if we would only disseminate
 good scores without any variation.
 Therefore, we take the distribution of ratings into account by using quintiles.
 Consequently, less dealers receive rating 4 or 5, more dealers receive
 rating 1 or 2.
 This could strengthen the effect of the treatment on dealer effort.
 If dealers get ratings 1 or 2 instead of 4 or 5, they could feel more inclined
 to improve their scores.
 Consequently, also the effect on seed quality itself could be larger.
 However, the clearinghouse should also have a signaling effect, which might
 be weaker if more dealers are rated 1 or 2 instead of 4 or 5 (dealers would
 seem to be of worse quality to farmers).
 Therefore, we chose words with a positive connotation as the quintile names
 for rating dissemination.
 As most dealers received a good or very good rating before taking the distribut
ion into account, we ensure that even a 2 is still communicated as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

good
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to farmers to not weaken the signaling effect.
 That is why the first quintile is translated to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

okay
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and gets one star, the second one is named 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

good
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and receives two stars, the third quintile is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

very good
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and gets three stars, the fourth and fifth one are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

excellent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and awarded with four and five stars.
 This way of considering the distribution of the original ratings when choosing
 the names also helps us to disseminate ratings as truthfully, purely and
 as closely to reality as possible.

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Are female dealers rated worse than male dealers?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because we found significant differences between the ratings of female (41%
 of dealers) and male agro-dealers (59% of dealers) after controlling for
 some potentially confounding variables like education and for several indicatio
ns of quality, we have no reason to believe that these differences in perception
 can be explained by differences in real quality.
 Instead, it is likely that women are perceived to be worse due to discriminatio
n 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, so that we adjusted the ratings of female dealers accordingly to prevent
 that they are harmed by our intervention.
 We regressed all seed quality attributes on the gender dummy and added
 the resulting coefficients to the initial ratings of female dealers.
