\begin_layout Abstract
To fully benefit from new agricultural technologies like improved seed varieties
, significant investment in complementary inputs such as fertilizers and
 pesticides, and practices such as systematic planting, irrigation, and
 weeding are also required.
 Farmers may fail to recognize the importance of these complements, leading
 to unsatisfactory crop yields and outputs and, eventually, dis-adoption
 of the variety.
 We provide a simple model of biased expectations, complementary input use
 and technology adoption and test its predictions using a field experiment
 among smallholder maize farmers in eastern Uganda.
 We find that pointing out the importance of complementary investments using
 a short, engaging video effectively deters some farmers from using commercial
 improved varieties.
 Consistent with the theoretical model, we find some evidence that this
 behavior change emanates from increased knowledge and expectations that
 are more in line with realized outcomes.

Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
To feed a growing population in an environmentally sustainable manner and
 in the midst of a long-term climate crisis, farmers throughout the developing
 world are expected to grow more food on less land with greater efficiency
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 To achieve this goal, much is expected from new technologies, especially
 from higher-yielding varieties that are resilient to pests, diseases, and
 other biotic stresses and are tolerant of droughts, floods, heat, and other
 abiotic stresses

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, the adoption of such technologies is lagging in areas where
 they may have the largest impact.
 Recent trends in agricultural productivity growth in Africa show that technolog
ical progress has largely stagnated on the continent 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "10.1257/jep.36.1.33"

\end_inset

.
 However, significant heterogeneity underlies this general stagnation.
 For instance, at the micro level, we often observe dis-adoption patterns
 and trends, where farmers choose to switch back to technologies and inputs
 they have been using for decades after trying out a new technology once
 or twice

\end_inset

.
 In many cases, these patterns and trends cannot be explained by a lack
 of awareness or information about, for example, improved cultivars or inorganic
 fertilizers

 the conventional agricultural production function.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many reasons why farmers may not move into a state of sustained
 adoption of a given technology.
 An obvious one is that farmers cannot access the technology through local
 markets or other means of supply, or may have enjoyed access only for a
 limited time as part of a promotional campaign or project intervention
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "https://doi.org/10.1111/agec.12175"

\end_inset

 Another reason may be that farmers learn over time that a particular technology
 is not suitable for them or does not meet their expectations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "CUSTODIO201619"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Heterogeneity in the quality of the technology, coupled with the fact that
 it is often difficult to assess quality prior to purchase or application,
 may also result in dis-adoption 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "10.1093/qje/qjx009,miehe2023lifting"

\end_inset

 Farmers that face credit or liquidity constraints, or additional uninsured
 risk may also reconsider past adoption behavior and tend towards dis-adoption
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "karlan2014agricultural"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In the longer run, general equilibrium effects that accrue as more farmers
 adopt a new technology, thereby increasing supply of the commodity and
 reducing output prices, may also lead farmers with higher marginal costs
 to exit the market and dis-adopt 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we consider the possibility that farmers hold inflated expectatio
ns of new technologies as an explanation for their dis-adoption.
 These inflated expectations result from the possibility that farmers may
 be unaware (or fail to recognize) the need for substantial complementary
 investment.
 Indeed, for the new hybrid seeds suitable for East African maize farmers
 that came on the market a few decades ago, the promise to double or even
 triple yields could typically only be achieved in favorable climatic conditions
 and with the addition of fertilizer and other inputs

 show that farming with improved maize varieties is far more costly than
 farming with unimproved maize varieties.
 The additional production costs include not just the (higher) cost of seed
 but also higher fertilizer costs required to achieve expected yield improvement
s, as well as higher costs of labor for farm tasks that are associated with
 the cultivation of higher-yielding maize.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inflated expectations about technology performance can have lasting impacts
 on adoption if farmers attribute poor outcomes to the technology, instead
 of to insufficient complementary inputs and effort.
 This learning failure is often understandable: if multiple factors simultaneous
ly affect yields and outputs, then learning about the causal impact of a
 new technology from a single experience is difficult, especially if the
 technology performs only under specific or stochastic circumstances such
 as abiotic stress 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, pays attention to the wrong attributes of the technology

\begin_layout Standard
This paper was motivated by evidence suggesting that many farmers are unaware
 that agricultural technologies such as improved varieties require substantial
 complementary inputs and efforts to reap benefits.
 Indeed, it is theoretically possible and quite reasonable to believe that
 farmers overestimate the returns to a technology and are disappointed when
 they compare realized yields with what they expected at the time of planting.
 Because it is hard for farmers to learn about the yield response of a single
 input, farmers may decide that the technology itself is to blame.
 This is consistent with the observation that farmers think inputs are often
 counterfeit or of low quality, even when objective assessments of input
 quality find them to be acceptable

\begin_layout Standard
Many researchers working in developing-country agriculture will have their
 own anecdotal evidence of inflated expectations that illustrate the presence
 of biased expectations, sub-optimal complementary investments, and subsequent
 dis-adoption when disappointing outcomes are attributed to the technology
 itself.
 For instance, researchers may be familiar with farmers' belief that using
 inorganic fertilizer for one cropping cycle will lead to long-lasting soil
 fertility improvements.
 Others may be familiar with another common belief among farmers—often promoted
 by extension agents and agro-dealers—that an improved variety is a

 that can be planted without additional inputs or management to achieve
 exceptional harvests.
 Entire narratives—some with more nuance than others—have been written on
 the singular power of genetic improvement, from the semi-dwarf

 An example the learning failure and its consequences was provided by extension
 agents we worked with.
 Seed of improved maize varieties need a lot of nutrients, often leaving
 soil more depleted than when farmer-saved seed is used.
 In the areas where our research is situated, Striga (
\shape italic
Striga hermonthica

), a parasitic weed that feeds on the roots of maize plants and cause stunted
 growth, is a serious problem.
 Unfortunately, Striga proliferates in poor soils and as a result some farmers
 now believe that improved seed varieties are responsible for increased
 Striga infestations on their fields.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To develop our theory of inflated expectations, we present a simple model
 of technology adoption that incorporates the ideas discussed above.
 In this model, farmers compare the expected returns of an improved technology
 to their business-as-usual choices.
 The new technology comes at a cost, while the unimproved technology does
 not.
 Both technologies, though, require complementary inputs and efforts that
 directly affect productivity, with productivity gains from the new technology
 only materializing when complementary inputs and practices exceed business-as-u
sual levels for the unimproved technology.
 Further, recognizing that farmers may be heterogeneous, we define several
 farmer types and derive predictions about how they might behave if they
 learn about the true shape of the production function of the new technology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We test our model's predictions using a field experiment conducted with
 almost 3,500 maize farmers in eastern Uganda.

 It was primarily designed to examine quality-related constraints to technology
 adoption with a series of interventions at the agro-input dealer level.
 This paper makes use of farmer-level interventions that were introduced
 alongside the main design and described in the pre-analysis plan.

 At the heart of the field experiment is a light-touch information intervention
 that highlights the importance of complementary investments when using
 improved maize varieties.

improved variety
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 throughout this paper to refer to both maize hybrids and open pollinated
 varieties marketed and sold in our study areas, as opposed to farmer-saved
 seed or seed obtained through farmer-to-farmer exchanges which, in the
 specific context of maize, may be less effective due to cross pollination
 and genetic drift over multiple generations, or due to poor seed storage
 and handling between seasons.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Specifically, we show all farmers in our sample a short, engaging video
 about the use of improved inputs and recommended management practices for
 maize cultivation.
 In the treatment group, we show the same video, except that in certain
 points in the narration—for instance when the use of inorganic fertilizers
 is demonstrated or when weeding is explained—we highlight the particular
 importance of using additional inputs and performing certain management
 practices in conjunction with the improved variety.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We begin by testing whether farmers are able to extract the relevant information
 from the treatment video.
 We see that all coefficients move in the expected direction, and find treatment
 effects that differ significantly from zero for a subset of farmers.
 Turning to adoption behavior, we find evidence of treated farmers dis-adopting
 between baseline and follow-up.
 We find no evidence that the intervention affected the use of complementary
 inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides, or recommended practices for
 maize management such as row planting and intensive weeding.
 We also see that among treated farmers, expectations become more in line
 with realized output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These findings have implications for our understanding of smallholder technology
 adoption dynamics.
 If farmers do not use appropriate complementary inputs and practices when
 using improved maize varieties because they believe in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

, their yields are likely to be disappointing.
 Often, disappointment about the performance of a technology is then erroneously
 attributed to the technology itself, potentially leading to dis-adoption.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Correcting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 incorrect beliefs about the needed inputs and efforts may result in farmers
 dis-adopting technologies in the short run.
 However, if farmers' expectations become more realistic, the ones that
 keep adopting (or start adopting in light of the new information) will
 be less likely to be disappointed in the future, leading to sustained adoption,
 which in turn could lead to efficiency gains and positive spillover effects.
 Our findings also imply that public and private actors in the agriculture
 sector need to promote new technologies as highly site- and context-specific
 combinations of technologies, inputs, practices, and efforts instead of

Agricultural technology adoption is at the heart of a rich body of research
 on food security, poverty reduction, economic development, and structural
 transformation.
 Studies on the economics of technical change in agriculture go back to
 at least 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 and are reviewed in widely cited articles such as

 and

 More recently and with the proliferation of field experiments and randomized
 controlled trials, economic theories that explore alternative drivers of
 technology adoption have received greater empirical attention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of these studies (implicitly) assume that some kind of graduation model
 underlies the technical change process, wherein farmers switch from a low-level
 equilibrium to a high-level equilibrium in which technology use is sustained
 once initial conditions—typically, access to information or finance—are
 satisfied or binding constraints removed

 Yet most of these studies follow farmers across a limited number of agricultura
l seasons, and are unable to fully appreciate the dynamics of technology
 adoption over time.
 Only a few studies offer a long-term perspective, with several documenting
 significant levels of dis-adoption

 is a model of learning failures where farmers have inflated expectations
 about the returns to a new technology, but fail to uncover the true form
 of the production function through experience, leading to disappointment
 and subsequent dis-adoption.
 Indeed, heterogeneity in farmer characteristics implies that farmers need
 to learn whether using a new technology is optimal for their specific context

 However, learning about a new technology is often difficult for reasons
 related to the technology's complexity and the observability of its quality
 or performance (i.e., its experience good nature)

One strand of the literature argues that sequential adoption leads to experienti
al learning by farmers.
 In cases where technologies are bundled in packages, it is often observed
 that farmers sequentially adopt components of the package, rather than
 adopting the entire package at once

 argue that this occurs when farmers employ a Bayesian approach to learning
 in which they try to isolate the impact of one component of the package
 at a time.
 However, there are circumstances under which this strategy is not optimal
 because it can prevent farmers from identifying potential synergies between
 technologies, inputs, and practices.
 Indeed, the reason why many interventions are presented as a package is
 because these interaction effects are not trivial.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 find that banana tissue culture, a technology to ensure that banana plantlets
 are free from pests and diseases, leads to a seven percent yield gain in
 Kenya.
 However, they also find that improving access to irrigation can lift yield
 gains above 20 percent.
 If many complementarities like this exist, it seems unlikely that farmers
 are in a position to follow a sequential learning path that allows for
 all possible interactions between the different technologies within a reasonabl
e time frame.
 Furthermore, as mentioned above, farmers may face certain behavioral constraint
s that inhibit their ability to learn about interaction effects if, for
 example, they pay attention to minor or tangential attributes of the package
 and miss the more important attributes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "10.1093/qje/qju015"

 Our study contributes to this literature by providing additional evidence
 on the limits of Bayesian learning in the context of agricultural technology
 adoption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another strand of the literature addresses the technology learning process
 in terms of how farmers compare realized yields against expected yields
 to inform their subsequent, longer-term adoption decisions.
 The effect of incorrect expectations about future returns on decision-making
 has been studied most in the context of education, but is readily applicable
 to learning in agriculture.
 For example, both

 finds that a video intervention that informs Ugandan farmers about the
 returns on intensification investments in rice growing improved practices
 and increased input use and production.
 Note that across these studies, it is assumed that the individual underestimate
s the returns in question.
 In our study, as a result of under-investment in complementary inputs,
 farmers are in a sense overestimating returns to a new technology, leading
 to over-investment in technologies.

Finally, the intervention we use to test our hypothesis builds on a strand
 of the literature that focuses on the role of video-mediated messaging
 to convey salient information to farmers.
 This literature explores the ways in which informational videos can change
 behavior in a variety of settings and through a range of mechanisms.

 These same households also report maize yields 10.5 percent higher than

 Our study uses a light touch intervention where treatment and control videos
 were very similar, expect for one small piece of information.
 Our study thus contributes to this literature by testing if videos are
 also effective in conveying subtle messages.

In a country like Uganda, where most grain is combined, milled, and sold
 without varietal denomination, this is a reasonable assumption.
 In other countries such as Malawi or Mexico, where consumers have distinct
 varietal preferences related to taste, texture, and color, this assumption
 might not always hold.

\begin_inset Formula $E\left(Y_{it+1}^{L}\right)$

 Seed of Variety L is assumed to be free, while for seed of Variety H,

 takes this into account but also notes that the cost of, in her case, farmer-sa
ved seed is likely to be low, if not zero.
 Rather than complicating the model by explicitly modeling the price of
 the stochastically inferior variety, we decide to set it to zero.
 Setting it to a small positive value would not change the predictions derived

For simplicity, we assume that farmers have only one plot and model the

Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows that adoption decisions fundamentally depend on yield comparisons.
 We assume that yield for Variety L is a function of inputs used:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Y_{it+1}^{L}=Y_{it}\left(X_{it}^{L}\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and that this relationship is assumed to be positive with decreasing returns
 to scale: 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dY_{it}}{dX_{it}}>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{d^{2}Y_{it}}{dX_{it}^{2}}<0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yield for Variety H follows the same function, but adds a positive and constant
 adoption premium 
\begin_inset Formula $(A>0)$
\end_inset

.
 However, the adoption premium only applies when the farmer uses at least
 the same amount of complementary inputs as they would when using Variety
 L 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(X_{it}^{H}\geq X_{it}^{L}\right)$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Y_{it+1}^{H}=A\left(X_{it}^{H}\geq X_{it}^{L}\right)+Y_{it}\left(X_{it}^{H}\right)\label{eq:truerel}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If farmers are able to predict yields—at least on average—in 
\emph on
t+1
\emph default
, such that 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(Y_{it+1}\right)=Y_{it+1}+\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon\sim N(0,\sigma)$
\end_inset

, their decision to adopt would depend on the difference in yield between
 Variety H and L, on the relative prices of inputs, and on the yield responses
 to the inputs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we introduce farmer heterogeneity into the model by assuming that
 at least some farmers are not aware of the true relationship between 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{it}^{H}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{it}$
\end_inset

, but instead believe that the adoption premium is always present, that
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(Y_{it+1}^{H}\right)=A+Y_{it}\left(X_{it}^{H}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 As a result, some farmer will use Variety H but not enough complementary
 inputs, leading to disappointing outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This variation in the model leads to different farmer-types based on their
 dynamic profile and knowledge, as summarized in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "types of farmers"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Some farmers are knowledgeable about the true relationship between 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{it}^{H}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{it}$
\end_inset

 in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

, and as a result make correct investment choices.
 For at least some of these farmers, referred to as Type 1 farmers in Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "types of farmers"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the marginal cost of adoption will be lower than the expected marginal
 return in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:three"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, and as a result they adopt (and will continue to do so in the future unless
 there is a change in fundamentals such as the cost of seed).
 For another subset of these farmers, referred to as Type 2 farmers in Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "types of farmers"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the marginal cost of adoption will be higher than the expected marginal
 return, so they will not adopt (and are unlikely to adopt in the near future).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another group of farmers is not knowledgeable about the true relationship
 between 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{it}^{H}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{it}$
\end_inset

 and believes there is always an adoption premium.
 A subset of these farmers may adopt because their marginal cost of adoption
 is lower than their expected marginal return.
 We refer to these farmers in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "types of farmers"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 as Type 3 farmers.
 Another subset of this group of farmers that is not knowledgeable about
 the true relationship between 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{it}^{H}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{it}$
\end_inset

, referred to as Type 4 farmers in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "types of farmers"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, does not adopt at baseline because, even though they have inflated expectation
s of Variety H's yield, the marginal cost of adoption still exceeds the
 expected marginal return.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another group of farmers is also not knowledgeable about the true relationship
 between 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{it}^{H}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{it}$
\end_inset

.
 But unlike Type 3 and 4 farmers, they underestimate the adoption premium
 (much like the rice farmers underestimate the returns to intensification
 investments in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1086/703868"

\end_inset

), perhaps due to a disappointing experience in the past.
 Some of these farmers, Type 5 in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "types of farmers"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, adopt at baseline as the expected marginal return may still be larger
 than the marginal cost of adoption, even if they underestimate the return.
 For another fraction of farmers that underestimate the adoption premium,
 referred to as Type 6 in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "types of farmers"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the expected marginal return will be less than the marginal cost of adoption,
 such that they do not adopt.

 incorrect beliefs about the relationship between the returns to Variety
 H and investments in inputs and practices (described in detail in the next
 section).
 In some cases, such as for adoption, effects for different farmers may
 go in opposite directions, potentially canceling out an overall average
 treatment effect.
 In other cases, such as for knowledge, some farmers may not be affected,
 diluting the overall effect.
 The model and the different farmer types summarized in Table

 allow us to make predictions on the impact of an intervention designed
 to increase knowledge about the true relationship between the performance
 of a stochastically dominant variety and complementary efforts on four
 key outcome areas: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Effect on knowledge: As Type 1 and 2 farmers are assumed to be already knowledge
able about the true relationship between 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{it}^{H}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{it}$
\end_inset

, the intervention will have little effect on them.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that we do not know which farmers are knowledgeable and which farmers
 are not as we only measure knowledge at endline to avoid priming effects.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Types 3 to 6 are assumed to be unaware of the true relationship between
 Variety H and complementary inputs and practices; the intervention will
 thus increase knowledge.
 The knowledge effect will be larger for farmers that adopt at baseline
 (Types 1, 3, 5) since this removes 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Never Adopters
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 who are likely to be less interested in the information (Types 2 and 4)
 from the sample.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Effect on adoption: We predict opposing effects on adoption behavior for
 farmer Types 3 and 6.
 Providing Type 3 farmers with information may cause them to dis-adopt if
 the new information reduces their expected marginal return below their
 marginal cost.
 For Type 6 farmers, the intervention may increase expectations of the return,
 and they may start adopting in response to the treatment if the increase
 is sufficiently high.
 Reducing expectations of farmers that do not adopt at baseline even though
 they have inflated expectations will not change their mind as this will
 reduce their expected returns even more (Type 4).
 Similarly, we do not expect that the intervention will change the adoption
 behavior of farmers who already adopt even though they underestimate potential
 yield effects (Type 5): these farmers will keep adopting as the intervention
 increases their expected returns to the stochastically dominant variety.
 Finally, as for knowledge, farmers that are aware of the correct relationship
 between inputs and Variety H (Types 1 and 2) are not expected to change
 adoption behavior in response to the intervention.
 The direction of the intervention's effect on adoption will thus depend
 on the share of Type 3 and 6 farmers respectively.
 Note that if we only consider farmers that adopt at baseline, the expected
 effect on adoption will be negative as this excludes Type 6 farmers from
 the analysis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Effect on expectations: We predict that the intervention results in expectations
 that are more in line with realized outcomes.
 This will likely only be the case for farmers that are unaware of the true
 relationship, and so we again do not expect an effect for Types 1 and 2.
 Furthermore, since our intervention aims to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

correct
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 perceptions only for Variety H, expectations of farmers that use Variety
 L at baseline are unlikely to be affected (as it is assumed that the production
 function of stochastically inferior varieties is common knowledge).
 Thus, we only expect an impact on farmers that plant the stochastically
 dominant variety at baseline and also have incorrect expectations (Types
 3 and 5).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Effect on use of inputs and practices: Some farmers that were unaware of
 the true relationship between Variety H and complementary inputs and practices
 and receive new information about the importance of these complements may
 start investing more.
 This will be especially the case for Type 6 farmers who adopt due to the
 intervention (potentially after previously dis-adopting due to disappointing
 outcomes in the past) and will put the new knowledge into practice.
 To a lesser extent, farmers that consider adoption to be profitable despite
 low yield expectations may try to further increase yields by increasing
 effort (Type 5).
 Hence, for inputs and efforts, we expect a positive effect that becomes
 less strong if we restrict ourselves to farmers that adopt at baseline.

\begin_layout Standard
The model predictions were tested using a field experiment conducted with
 almost 3,500 maize farmers in eastern Uganda.
 The intervention consisted of screening short, engaging videos about best
 practices in maize cultivation.
 The videos were shown individually to participating farmers on tablet computers
 by specially trained field enumerators.
 The content of the video scripts was developed following extensive interviews
 with experts, including agricultural extension agents, plant breeders,
 seed producers, government officials, and farmers themselves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The video opens with a woman and a man standing in a well-kept maize plot
 inspecting their crop.
 The couple explains that they have been farmers for more than ten years
 but that their fields have not always been productive.
 They recount how they used to struggle to feed their children, but that
 over time, they learned how to grow more maize on less land.
 The secret of their success, the couple continues, lies in the adoption
 of improved technologies and best practices, such as the use of organic
 fertilizer, optimal plant spacing, and reduced seed rates.
 Furthermore, they explain that the use of an improved variety and inorganic
 fertilizer contributed significantly to increased production.
 They conclude this introduction by stating that they are proud to be successful
 farmers who can feed their families and even produce surpluses that they
 can sell in the market.
 The viewer is then invited to become equally successful in farming by paying
 close attention as the featured (role model) farmers explain in detail
 the most important technologies, inputs, and practices that transformed
 their lives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The treatment was implemented in the form of two variations of this video.
 The control group viewed the video as described above.
 The treatment group viewed a similar video that differed slightly in terms
 of content.
 Specifically, we added subtle recommendations for inputs and practices
 that are particularly important when cultivating improved maize varieties.
 The only difference between the control and treatment videos is that the
 latter makes explicit the fact that significant complementarities exist
 between improved varieties and recommended inputs and practices such as
 inorganic fertilizers and row planting.
 In effect, the treatment and control videos are identical, except that,
 after each practice or input that is shown, the treatment video explicitly
 mentions that the practice or input is

For example, in the control video, the farmer explains that:

At planting time, I paid attention to recommended spacing, carefully measuring
 1 foot between plants and 2.5 feet between rows.
 I first dug a 4-inch deep hole and added 1 water bottle cap of Di-Ammonium
 Phosphate (DAP).
 Then I added some soil.
 Afterwards, I put 1 maize seed in and covered it with soil.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 In the treatment video, the farmer narrates the same scene but adds a pointed
 comment at the end of the exposition, stating: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

By randomizing which video is viewed by our sampled farmers, we can isolate
 the causal effect of making salient the fact that improved varieties do
 not substitute for inputs and effort, but in fact require more investment.
 The use of a control video has an additional advantage: since it is not
 clear to farmers or enumerators which video is the treatment and which
 is the control, we reduce the likelihood that results are driven by experimente
r demand effects

\begin_layout Standard
The experiment targeted the second agricultural season of 2021, where maize
 is sown in August and September and harvested in November and December.
 We implemented the treatment in April 2021, well before the start of the
 season, to ensure that farmers had the necessary information before making
 decisions on seed and input use.
 At this point in time, we also collected baseline data on our sample households.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The intervention was repeated just before planting in August 2021, and post-trea
tment data was collected in January and February 2022.
 The intervention was again repeated in the first season of 2022, with a
 final round of data collection conducted in July and August 2022.
 Note that this paper focuses on outcomes following the 2021 agricultural
 season since we do not expect significant results from continuing the intervent
ion (i.e., providing farmers with the same information) in 2022.
 However, we do explore descriptive results from 2022 to provide insight
 into patterns of sustained adoption among treated farmers.

\begin_layout Standard
The field experiment was conducted in southeastern Uganda, an area known
 for its maize production by smallholder farmers, and where maize is considered
 both a food and cash crop.
 Because it was conducted as part of a larger study on maize seed supply
 chains, farmers were drawn from the catchment areas (market-sheds) of agro-inpu
t shops.
 The sampling frame was developed as follows: first, we listed all agro-input
 shops in 11 districts in southeastern Uganda, resulting in the identification
 of 347 agro-input dealers.
 We then asked these dealers to identify the villages where most of their
 customers come from.
 This sampling frame allows us to assume that sampled farmers have both
 reasonable and similar access to improved maize varieties if they choose
 to adopt as a result of our intervention, and that other constraining factors
 such as seed quality, credit access, or individual preferences were similarly
 distributed across our treatment and control groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, field supervisors compiled household lists for each village and randomly
 sampled ten maize-cultivating households per village using systematic sampling
 (nth name selection technique).
 The enumerators interviewed 3,470 farmers using a household survey instrument
 that contained a wide range of questions about the individual, their household,
 and their farm.
 From an initial sample of 3,470 farmers who were interviewed in the baseline
 survey round, only 63 farmers dropped out in the subsequent survey round.
 We did not find that attrition differed significantly between treatment
 and control group, and thus proceed with the analysis on a balanced panel
 of 3,407 farmers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Adoption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we explore the dynamics of improved variety adoption by
 smallholder farmers in our study area.
 We define adoption of improved maize varieties as follows.
 First, we asked farmers on how many plots they cultivated maize during
 the preceding season.
 From these plots, we randomly selected one plot and asked detailed questions
 about seed and varietal use, input use, and management practices.
 Based on the information collected, we then defined a farmer as an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Adopter
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if they used either non-recycled (newly purchased, not saved) seed of (a)
 a hybrid or (b) an open pollinated variety.
 All others were defined as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Non-adopters
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We acknowledge that this definition of adoption is not perfect.
 Seed of an open pollinated variety that has been recycled (saved) up to
 four times could still be considered as improved, and farmers using this
 seed could still be counted as adopters.
 However, we expect the problem of incorrect beliefs about 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

miracle seeds
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and biased expectations to be most pronounced when smallholders do not
 have experience with the seed.
 If farmers recycle and use seed several times, their beliefs about the
 relationship between efforts and the returns to improved varieties will
 become closer to reality as they learn from season to season.
 That is why this stricter definition is useful to answer the questions
 raised in this paper.
 Also, most of our results remain robust to different definitions of adoption.

 illustrates the evolution of varietal adoption among farmers over different
 survey rounds using this definition.
 We see that the share of adopters slowly increases over time: at Survey
 1 (baseline), about 43 percent of farmers report to have sown an improved
 maize variety on the randomly selected plot.
 At the end of the first season, at the time of Survey 2 in January 2022,
 this figure increased to about 49 percent and, by Survey 3 in July and
 August 2022, to about 52 percent.

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 also illustrates the dynamics of adoption in our sample.
 At the top, we see a substantial share of households (19 percent) that
 adopted in all three survey rounds.
 These could be considered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Always Adopters
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or Type 1 and Type 5 farmers, as described earlier.
 At the bottom of the chart, we find an equally substantial share (22 percent)
 that can similarly be categorized as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Never Adopters
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or Type 2 and Type 4 farmers.
 However, we also see that a large group of farmers that adopts during Survey
 1 reverts to farmer-saved seed at the time of the second survey (13 percent)
 or still adopts at the time of Survey 2 but eventually dis-adopts at the
 time of Survey 3 (6 percent).
 During this same period, large numbers of households also start adopting.
 We see that 19 percent of non-adopting households adopt at the time of
 Survey 2 and 10 percent of households do not adopt in both Surveys 1 and
 2 but do adopt by Survey 3.
 Finally, we find that the some households seem to be moving in and out
 of adoption (7 percent) or moving out and back into adoption (6 percent).

Another indication of the dynamic nature of adoption is the fact that a
 substantial share of farmers that adopted at the time of the first survey
 seemed to be disappointed.
 Baseline data shows that 30 percent of farmers indicated that were not
 satisfied with the quality of the planting material that they used; one
 in four indicated that they will not use the seed again in the future.

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the random assignment of participants to treatment and control groups,
 comparing outcome variable averages of treated and control participants
 provides unbiased estimates of the average treatment effects.
 Using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) regression framework, we regress
 outcomes of interest (knowledge, adoption, input use and effort, and expectatio
ns) on an indicator variable that takes the value of 1 if the household
 was in the treatment group and 0 otherwise, and include baseline values
 of the outcome variables as controls.
 Furthermore, as this study was part of a larger project with additional
 cross-randomized treatments, controls are included for the orthogonal treatment
s (demeaned and interacted with the main (video) treatment

 is used, with standard errors clustered at the village level, the level
 of randomization.
 For each of the four outcome families (knowledge, adoption, input use and
 effort, and expectations), we compute outcome indices, which is a common
 way to account for multiple hypothesis testing.
 To do so, we follow

 of the outcome variables.
 The weights are derived from the (inverse) covariance matrix, such that
 less weight is given to outcomes that are highly correlated with each other.
 For these indices, signs of outcomes were switched where necessary so that
 the positive direction always indicates a “better” outcome.

Results

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We look at impact on knowledge, adoption, expectations and harvest, and
 inputs and practices in separate subsections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Impact on knowledge
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, we examine whether the treated participants are able to pick up the
 subtle messages in the treatment video.
 According to Prediction 1, we expect a positive effect of the treatment
 on farmers' knowledge, and a larger effect for farmers that adopt at baseline.
 We test farmer knowledge by means of a short quiz where a number of questions
 were asked and enumerators read a set of alternative answers to farmers
 who then selected the response that they felt most appropriate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The quiz begins with a general question asking farmers whether they think
 recommended cultivation practices like weeding and fertilizer application
 are less, equally, or more important when using improved varieties.
 This is followed by a more specific multiple-choice question on a particular
 practice—weeding—when cultivating an improved variety.
 Response options are: (1) you do not need to weed and remove Striga because
 seed of improved varieties is treated to resist weed infestation; (2) you
 do not need to weed and remove Striga in the first four weeks because seed
 of improved varieties is better at competing for sun, nutrients, and water
 than normal seed; and (3) you need to weed and remove Striga just as you
 would with unimproved varieties because maize seed does not compete well
 for sunlight, water, and nutrients.
 The quiz contains a similar question a key input as well—fertilizer—when
 cultivating an improved variety.
 The options here are: (1) you do not need to use inorganic fertilizer because
 you already purchased seed; (2) you can use less fertilizer than you normally
 would since seed of an improved maize variety grows faster; (3) you need
 to use the amount of fertilizer that you would with unimproved varieties
 because also seed of an improved variety needs nutrition; and (4) you should
 use more fertilizer than you would normally use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The quiz also contains a question that checks if farmers use sub-optimal
 plots to cultivate improved varieties by asking which plots are best suited.
 Response options are: (1) that it is best to save seed of an improved variety
 for poor plots, as it needs less nutrients; (2) that is best to use seed
 of an improved variety for plots that are furthest away from the home,
 as it needs less care; and (3) that the decision on what plot to plant
 seed should not be affected by the seed type.
 Another question explores how farmers think about the optimal investment
 in agriculture, i.e., whether to invest their resources in a single input
 or in a combination of inputs.
 The options are: (1) it is best to invest all your money in seed, because
 poor seed quality is the main cause of low yields; (2) it is best to invest
 all your money in fertilizer, because poor soil is the main cause of low
 yields; and (3) it is best to buy both fertilizer and seed, because good
 seed without fertilizer does not give good results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the quiz includes a control question, answers to which are not
 expected to differ between treatment and control groups because they are
 featured in both versions of the video.
 Specifically, the question asks about the optimal spacing and seed rate
 for maize, with response options as: (1) one foot between plants and two
 and a half feet between rows with one seed per hill; (2) one foot between
 plants and two and a half feet between rows with two seeds per hill; and
 (3) two feet between plants and two and a half feet between rows with two
 seeds per hill.
 The four outcomes (excluding the control question) are also combined in
 an index following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1198/016214508000000841"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Estimates of the average treatment effects on knowledge can be found in
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:knowledge"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The first column (1) provides the mean in the control group (with standard
 deviations in brackets below), mainly to get an idea of effect sizes.
 We see that knowledge is already high: 87 percent of farmers in the control
 group know that recommended inputs and cultivation practices like weeding
 or applying fertilizer are also important when using improved varieties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Column (2) shows the estimated difference between the treatment and control
 groups for outcomes after the intervention, while Column (3) also reports
 this difference, but only for the subset of farmers that adopted an improved
 variety at baseline.
 The rationale for restricting our sample is alluded to in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Theoretical-framework"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

: because the restricted sample retains farmers for whom the treatment effect
 is likely to be largest, we expect larger estimates in Column (3) than
 in Column (2).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that knowledge, as measured by the quiz questions, increases for
 all variables, and generally more so for the subset of farmers that used
 an improved variety at baseline.
 For instance, the share of farmers that knows complementary inputs and
 practices are at least as important when using improved varieties increases
 from 87.1 to 89.3 percent.
 Furthermore, the share of farmers that recommends investing in different
 inputs (as opposed to investing all money in only one input), increases
 from 73.5 to 75.7 percent.
 If we only consider farmers that adopted at baseline, the increase over
 the control amounts to almost five percentage points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After adjusting standard errors for clustering at the village level, none
 of the differences for the entire sample is statistically significant at
 conventional levels.
 However, if we only consider the subset of farmers that adopted at baseline,
 we see that the intervention increased knowledge, as measured by the index,
 significantly, probably because these farmers were more interested in this
 information.
 The overall effect is driven by increased knowledge about optimal agricultural
 investments among treated farmers.
 Even though we cannot defect a treatment effect for the entire sample,
 we note that all coefficient estimates are moving in the same direction.
 This may be due to the fact that, ex-post, it turns out that many of the
 farmers were already able to indicate the correct response, and hence there
 is little scope for further improvement.
 The significant results for the baseline adopters are in line with Prediction
 1 in Section

\begin_layout Standard
We now test the main hypothesis of this paper: whether farmers who were
 informed with subtle messages that improved varieties need substantial
 investment in complementary inputs and management practices behave differently
 in terms of seed use in subsequent seasons than farmers that were not similarly
 informed.
 To this end, we asked farmers which maize variety they planted on the randomly
 selected maize plot in the season prior to the survey.
 We again define adoption as described earlier and used in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Dynamics-of-seed"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 In addition, we investigate other outcomes that are related or even partly
 overlapping.
 For instance, we test if there are differences in the use of recycled seed
 between the treatment and control group, where we define recycled seed
 as seed that a farmer has saved themselves or obtained from another farmer
 who saved it (e.g., a neighbor or relative).
 Another related outcome is the share of farmers that report having purchased
 seed from an agro-input shop.
 The three outcomes are also combined in an index following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 and show that the intervention decreases adoption.
 Column (1) shows sample means of the four outcomes at baseline with standard
 deviations in the brackets below.
 We find that 44 percent of farmers use fresh seed of improved varieties
 and that one-third of farmers reports that the seed that they planted on
 the randomly selected plot was obtained from an agro-input dealer.
 Column (2) shows pre-treatment balance between treatment and control groups.
 We see that the randomization was successful, as there is no significant
 difference in varietal adoption behavior between farmers that will be exposed
 to the treatment and those that will not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Column (3) shows the difference between treatment and control groups for
 outcomes after the intervention.
 Our theory suggests that in response to being sensitized about the importance
 of using complementary inputs and management practices when using an improved
 variety, some farmers (Types 3 and 6) will change their adoption behavior
 (Prediction 2 in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Theoretical-framework"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 A share of farmers that initially underestimated the returns to improved
 varieties (Type 6) will start adopting as their expected marginal return
 is increased by the treatment.
 Another share of farmers that initially overestimated the probability of
 an adoption premium (Type 3) will dis-adopt as their expected marginal
 return is reduced by the treatment.
 We find that adoption, as measured by the index, significantly decreases
 for the entire sample.
 Furthermore, all coefficients move in the direction of dis-adoption.
 This implies that farmers are less likely to use improved seed and seed
 bought at an agro-input shop but more likely to use farmer-saved seed in
 accordance with our earlier definitions of adoption.
 Since the two opposing effects for farmer Types 3 and 6 partly cancel each
 other out, the dis-adoption effect is not pronounced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To separate the two opposing effects, we restrict the sample to farmers
 that adopted at baseline in Column (4).
 We see that the estimated effects become stronger when we restrict attention
 to this subgroup (and exclude Type 6 farmers from the analysis).
 Farmers who were exposed to the treatment are almost eight percentage points
 less likely to adopt fresh seed of an improved variety.
 We see another particularly strong increase in the share of farmers that
 uses seed recycled from the previous harvest in the treatment group and
 a somewhat lower but still significant reduction in farmers who bought
 seed from an agro-input dealer.
 The treatment also has a significant and more pronounced negative effect
 on the adoption index for this subgroup of farmers that adopted at baseline.

\begin_layout Standard
Since the intervention is designed to affect farmer behavior by

 their expectations, we explore the plausibility of this impact pathway
 by testing if post-intervention farmers feel their yield expectations were
 met.
 As mentioned in Prediction 3 in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Theoretical-framework"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

, we think this will particularly be the case if we restrict the sample
 to farmers that adopt at baseline.
 We also measure harvest-related outcomes (production and yield) on a randomly
 selected maize plot.
 The three outcomes are also combined in an index following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

The results in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 show that yield expectations have been significantly affected.
 We again report baseline means and balance in Columns (1) and (2).
 However, we did not ask if expectations were met at baseline, and so we
 report the control group average post-intervention and do not test for
 baseline balance for the expectations variable.
 Note that a large majority of farmers indicated that they harvested less
 than expected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Column (3) shows that, in line with our prediction, a significantly higher
 share of farmers in the treatment group state that they produced what they
 expected.
 The effect is larger for the subset of farmers that adopted at baseline,
 see Column (4).
 This suggests that a subset of farmers indeed started out with inflated
 expectations, which were

Finally, the table shows that the average farmer produces about 460 kg of
 maize on the randomly selected plot.
 The average size of these plots is slightly larger than one acre on average,
 such that yields are about 440 kg per acre.
 The intervention does not seem to have any impact on maize production or
 yield.

\begin_layout Subsection
Impact on use of inputs and practices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we investigate how the intervention affects the use of inputs (other
 than seed) and practices.
 For inputs and practices, the effect is expected to be positive, but weak
 (see Prediction 4 in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Theoretical-framework"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We examine a range of cultivation practices and complementary inputs in
 line with what is featured in both treatment and control videos.
 The first outcome is an indicator for single–stand row planting.
 Row planting is an important management practice that can lead to significant
 yield gains.
 Under row planting, space is used optimally such that plants have sufficient
 nutrients, sunlight, and room to grow.
 However, row planting increases workload, meaning farmers often engage
 in broadcast planting, which is less demanding on their labor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reducing the seeding rate (i.e., the number of seeds sown) is the second outcome
 of interest.
 Farmers often plant more seed than necessary because they fear that it
 may not germinate.
 However, using more than two seeds per hill leads to stunted maize growth
 due to competition for light and nutrients.
 At the same time, just as for row planting, a lower seed rate may increase
 the workload, as farmers need to engage in gap filling after one week if
 seeds fail to germinate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next three outcomes relate to fertilizer use.
 The application of organic fertilizer is important for soil structure,
 while inorganic fertilizers such as di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) or nitrogen,
 phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) and urea (nitrogen) are used to provide
 essential nutrients at particular points in time.
 The cost of organic fertilizer is mainly in terms of labor, whereas both
 DAP and urea need to be bought from an agro-input shop and applied during
 planting (DAP) and at early stages of growth (urea).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Farmers should weed within the first week after planting and as often as
 possible.
 Official recommendations are to weed at least three times per seasons.
 Furthermore, invasive insects such as the fall armyworm (
\emph on
Spodoptera frugiperda
\emph default
) or maize stalk borer (
\emph on
Busseola fusca
\emph default
) can severely reduce yields.
 Pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides are widely available
 in agro-input shops under commercial names such as Rocket, Lalafos and
 Dudu acelamectin.
 While weeding requires labor, pesticides come at a pecuniary cost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we look at differences in re-sowing or gap-filling.
 This involves revisiting the plot after planting and inspecting the hills
 for seed germination.
 If a seed does not germinate, a new seed is planted in that location.
 Re-sowing, reduced seed rate, and row-planting are thus likely to be correlated.
 We also combine all outcomes in an overall index following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1198/016214508000000841"
literal "false"

\begin_layout Standard
Results are reported in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and show no impact of the intervention on the use of inputs and practices.
 As in previous tables, Columns (1) and (2) report means and orthogonality
 for outcomes before the treatment.
 We find an imbalance for the number of times that a farmer reports to have
 weeded and the likelihood that farmers re-sow after one week.
 Note that the imbalance goes in different directions, which makes it less
 likely that it is caused by a structural difference between treatment and
 control group such as consistently lower efforts in one group, and more
 likely to be the result of chance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Column (3) shows that farmers do not invest more effort in response to the
 intervention.
 On the contrary (and especially if we only consider the subset of farmers
 that adopted at baseline, see Column (4)), farmers appear to be less likely
 to plant in rows.
 The negative effect on some practices may be due to the fact that farmers
 may adopt some complementary inputs or practices, but in sufficient quantities
 and/or suboptimal combinations for the adoption premium to realize.
 When farmers subsequently dis-adopt, they may also stop using these inputs
 or practices, leading to a negative expected effect on practices for type
 3 farmers in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "types of farmers"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 In particular, for the case of row planting, it may be that farmers that
 adopt at baseline simply follow planting instructions that are typically
 printed on the seed bags.
 However, only row-planting without additional inputs such as fertilizer
 or pesticide use may not lead to expected yields, and disappointed farmers
 may dis-adopt in the next season which case they may also revert to plating
 methods used before adoption.

\begin_layout Standard
This paper was motivated by evidence suggesting that farmers are often unaware
 that many agricultural technologies such as improved seed varieties require
 substantial complementary inputs, better management practices, and greater
 effort for their benefits to be realized.
 In a sense, farmers overestimate the returns to a technology and are disappoint
ed when they compare expectations to realized yields.
 As learning about a new technology is hard, farmers may attribute the disappoin
ting results to the technology itself and dis-adopt.
 This is consistent with findings suggesting that farmers blame poor returns
 on inputs they believe to be counterfeit or of low quality even when objective
 quality assessments show otherwise

\begin_layout Standard
To credibly test this hypothesis—specifically, that farmers think of improved
 varieties as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

miracle seed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

—we conducted a field experiment built around a short, engaging video on
 recommended input use and management practices for maize cultivation in
 eastern Uganda.
 We produced two versions of the video that differ only in terms of the
 presence (absence) of subtle messaging about the salience of recommended
 inputs and practices for the treatment (control) group.
 Screenings of the two versions were randomly assigned to villages in our
 study area, and then to maize farmers in those villages, resulting in a
 sample of almost 3,500 farmers who were interviewed at regular intervals
 to uncover any changes in their knowledge about best practices in maize
 cultivation as well as their seed or variety choices, their expectations
 of yield and output, and their use of complementary inputs and management
 practices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we do not find treatment effects that differ significantly from zero
 for knowledge outcomes for the entire sample, we do observe that all coefficien
ts move in the expected direction and suspect that the lack of statistical
 significance may be caused by low power given an already high level of
 knowledge among our sampled farmers.
 We do find, consistent with our theory, that the intervention significantly
 improved knowledge for farmers that adopted at baseline, probably because
 they were more interested in the information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the main outcome of interest—behavior related to seed choices—we find
 that treated farmers were less likely to use improved varieties, and generally
 more likely to dis-adopt.
 We also find that farmers that received the treatment were more likely
 to report that their harvest was in line with what they expected.
 Both findings are again consistent with our theory.
 We found no overall effect of the treatment on input use and management
 practices, although there is some indication that especially costly inputs
 and practices were reduced.
 Taken together, we conclude that there are indeed indications that farmers
 consider improve maize seed varieties as

\end_inset

 and that it is challenging to learn from own experience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our findings have implications for the study of technology adoption dynamics.
 We have seen that disappointment about the performance of a technology
 that is erroneously attributed to the technology itself may lead to dis-adoptio
n.
 As long as this learning failure is not corrected—for instance, by pointing
 out that the seed is good; the problem is with complementary input use—farmers
 will not adopt anew.
 Worse, as we learned from extension workers who complain farmers blame
 improved seed varieties for the proliferation of the parasitic

 leading to dis-adoption at more aggregate levels, further complicating
 (social) learning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Related to this, information about complementarities and changes in perceptions
 may reduce risk premia, particularly in the longer run.
 In this scenario, farmers try improved seed with complementary inputs and
 learn that outcomes are consistently in line with expectations.
 They may trade off this reduction in risk with with increased investment
 (and potentially lower margins).
 This seems to be what we find as well: When we revisited the farmers after
 one additional agricultural season, we no longer found any differences
 between treatment and control groups.
 At least some farmers who had disadopted in response to new information
 and more realistic expectations were, in fact, cultivating the new variety
 again; these may now be in for the long run.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our study also casts some doubt on the suggestion that Bayesian learning
 via sequential adoption can be a successful strategy for smallholder farmers
 in the long run 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 If there are important interaction effects between technologies, inputs
 and practices, it seems unreasonable to assume that farmers can try out
 all possible combinations of inputs to learn about these interactions in
 a Bayesian fashion, at least in a reasonable time frame.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our results differ from other studies that find that improved technologies
 increase agricultural productivity by crowding in modern inputs and cultivation
 practices

 A possible explanation for our opposing results may be that

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 provided the improved technology (also an improved seed variety) for free
 as part of the experiment, potentially resulting in an income effect, i.e.,
 the money that treated farmers did

 do discuss the possibility that their effects are driven by an income effect.
 However, in the presence of an income effect, they understand the effect
 of the additional income resulting from the adoption of the technology
 (a flood-tolerant rice variety).
 The income effect we are concerned about is one that results from farmers
 receiving seed for free, potentially freeing up money for other investments.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In our experiment, no free seed was provided, so when adoption decisions
 were made, farmers had to take the combined cost of seed 
\shape italic
and
\shape default
 cost of complementary inputs into account, further eroding the expected
 profitability of the improved technology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, our findings have implications for how public and private actors
 in the agriculture sector should promote new technologies.
 If smallholders' information sources such as private input dealers and
 public extension agents are not sufficiently able to communicate the importance
 of complementary inputs and practices, then lower likelihoods of sustained
 adoption may result.
 Worse, if smallholders have incorrect perceptions about poor quality caused
 by misattribution, the persistence of these perceptions may crowd out the
 market for quality inputs 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 And while the distribution of free or subsidized technologies and inputs
 may go some way in encouraging farmers' learning processes and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

correcting
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 their perceptions (for example, with unique standalone technologies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

), this approach can break down when complementary inputs and practices
 are not part of the package, which may again lead to disappointment among
 farmers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our findings suggest that agricultural development programs, extension providers
, and agri-input companies need to focus less on marketing single

 technologies for smallholders, and more on the design and communication
 of comprehensive packages that include both agronomic and economic information
 on topics such as expected variation in yield and output, sensitivity of
 timing for specific farming tasks, magnitude and costs of family and hired
 labor, and the relative drudgery of effort, among many others.
 We conclude that the design and communication of comprehensive packages
 requires greater investment in the form and content of rural education,
 extension and advisory services, and agri-input marketing strategies.
