Miracle seeds: Biased expectations, complementary input use, and the dynamics
 of smallholder technology adoption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
To fully benefit from new agricultural technologies like improved seed varieties
, significant investment in complementary inputs such as fertilizers and
 pesticides, and practices such as systematic planting, irrigation, and
 weeding are also required.
 Farmers may fail to recognize the importance of these complements, leading
 to disappointing crop yields and outputs and, eventually, dis-adoption
 of the improved variety.
 Using a field experiment, we test an information intervention among smallholder
 maize farmers in eastern Uganda that points out these complementarities.
 We find that farmers adopt less after they have been sensitized about the
 need to use complementary inputs to unlock the adoption premium.
 We rationalize this finding with a simple theoretical model where farmers
 have misspecified mental models of the technology production function and
 conclude that most farmers in our sample do indeed believe in miracle seeds.

To feed a growing population in an environmentally sustainable manner and
 in the midst of a long-term climate crisis, farmers throughout the developing

 To achieve this goal, much is expected from new technologies, especially
 from higher-yielding varieties that are resilient to pests, diseases, and
 other biotic stresses and are tolerant of droughts, floods, heat, and other
 abiotic stresses

Unfortunately, the adoption of such technologies is lagging in areas where
 they may have the largest impact.
 Recent trends in agricultural productivity growth in Africa show that technolog
ical progress has largely stagnated on the continent

 However, significant heterogeneity underlies this general stagnation.
 For instance, at the micro level, we often observe dis-adoption patterns
 and trends, where farmers choose to switch back to technologies and inputs
 they have been using for decades after trying out a new technology once
 or twice

For simplicity, we use the term

 are genetic innovations embodied in seed.
 We use the term

 the term

 Of course, we recognize that these terms can be used interchangeably—seed
 is also an input, while fertilizers and precision practices can also be
 technologies—and that each figures differently into our understanding of
 the conventional agricultural production function.

There are many reasons why farmers may not move into a state of sustained
 adoption of a given technology.
 For neoclassical explanations such as credit constraints or risk aversion,
 the reader is referred to the excellent reviews by

 In this paper, we take a more behavioral economics approach and consider
 the possibility that farmers' inflated expectations of new technologies
 explain their dis-adoption.
 These inflated expectations may result from farmers being unaware, failing
 to recognize, or downplaying the importance of the need for substantial
 complementary investment.
 Indeed, for the new hybrid seeds suitable for East African maize farmers
 that came on the market a few decades ago, the promise to double or even
 triple yields could typically only be achieved in favorable climatic conditions
 and with the addition of fertilizer and other inputs

 show that farming with improved maize varieties is far more costly than
 farming with unimproved maize varieties.
 The additional production costs include not only the (higher) cost of seed
 but also of fertilizer required to achieve expected yield improvements,
 as well as higher costs of labor for farm tasks are associated with the
 cultivation of higher-yielding maize.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The impact of inflated expectations due to insufficient complementary input
 use on future adoption behavior is complex and depends on what the unexpected
 outcome is attributed to, and hence on learning.
 Learning about a new technology is difficult: as multiple factors simultaneousl
y affect yields and outputs, learning about the causal impact of a new technolog
y from a single experience is hard, especially if the technology performs
 only under specific or stochastic circumstances such as abiotic stress

\begin_layout Standard
Inflated expectations are likely to have a negative impact on future adoption
 if farmers attribute disappointing outcomes to the seed itself.
 However, as there are different types of seed and seed quality is known
 to vary, farmers may be tempted to try again at some point in the future,
 particularly if neighbors get better results and extension workers are
 promoting improved seed varieties.
 Alternatively, farmers may attribute disappointing outcomes to other factors
 such as weather events, so that they are likely to adopt again in the future.
 Finally, if farmers attribute disappointing outcomes to the correct cause
 (insufficient complementary investment), farmers may re-optimize in light
 of the additional cost of complementary inputs and practices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many researchers working in developing-country agriculture will have their
 own anecdotal evidence of inflated expectations that illustrate the presence
 of biased expectations, sub-optimal complementary investments, and subsequent
 (temporary) dis-adoption when disappointing outcomes are attributed to
 the technology itself.
 For instance, researchers may be familiar with farmers' belief that using
 inorganic fertilizer for one cropping cycle will lead to long-lasting soil
 fertility improvements.
 Others may be familiar with another common belief among farmers—often promoted
 by extension agents and agro-dealers—that an improved variety is a

 Specifically, we show all farmers in our sample a short, engaging video
 about the use of improved inputs and recommended management practices for
 maize cultivation.
 In the treatment group, we show the same video, except that in certain
 points in the narration—for instance when the use of inorganic fertilizers
 is demonstrated or when weeding is explained—we highlight the particular
 importance of using additional inputs and performing certain management
 practices in conjunction with the improved variety, and manage expectations
 by stressing that farmers should not skimp on this input or practice because
 improved seed varieties are not

miracle seeds
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first check whether farmers are able to extract the relevant information
 from the treatment video and find that treated farmers better select the
 correct answer in a quiz on the use of complementary investments.
 Turning to adoption behavior, we find, somewhat surprisingly, that farmers
 in the treatment group are less likely to adopt improved seed varieties
 than control group farmers.
 We find no evidence that the intervention affected the use of complementary
 inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides or recommended practices for
 maize management such as weeding frequency and re-planting.
 We do see, however, that among treated farmers, expectations with respect
 to maize yield after the treatment tend to be more in line with realized
 output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To explain the negative impact of our information treatment on adoption,
 we develop a simple model of technology adoption.
 In this model, farmers compare the expected returns of an improved technology
 (seed) to their business-as-usual choices.
 The new technology comes at a cost, while the unimproved technology does
 not.
 Yet, both technologies require complementary inputs and efforts that directly
 affect productivity, with productivity gains from the new technology—the
 adoption premium—only materializing when complementary inputs and practices
 exceed business-as-usual levels.
 We then introduce heterogeneity in the beliefs that farmers hold about
 the nature of the production function of the new technology: some farmers
 know that additional complementary inputs and practices are needed to obtain
 the adoption premium, other farmers believe in miracle seeds and think
 that the adoption premium is also present if they apply complementary inputs
 and practices as they normally would.
 Finally, there is a group of farmers who do not believe in any adoption
 premium, perhaps because they have been disappointed in the past.
 The model is then used to derive predictions on the treatment effect for
 specific subgroups, and tested by estimating the effect on subsamples of
 participants.
 Results suggest that a substantial share of our study population believes
 in miracle seeds: they believe improved seeds are profitable under a misspecifi
ed production function but not when all costs of complementary inputs and
 practices are considered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These findings have implications for our understanding of smallholder technology
 adoption dynamics.
 If farmers do not use appropriate complementary inputs and practices when
 using improved maize varieties because they believe in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

miracle seeds
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, their yields will likely be disappointing.
 Often, disappointment about the performance of a technology is then erroneously
 attributed to the technology itself, leading farmers to continue using
 local seed.
 In the aggregate, this is likely to lead to lower than optimal adoption.
 Providing this information up front can save farmers from the disappointment
 and financial loss of failed attempts.
 Additionally, correcting beliefs may prompt some of these disappointed
 farmers to re-evaluate costs and benefits of using improved seed, which
 may increase adoption in the long run.
 Our findings also have important policy implications: public and private
 actors in the agriculture sector need to promote new technologies as highly
 site- and context-specific combinations of technologies, inputs, practices,
 and efforts instead of single

Agricultural technology adoption is at the heart of a rich body of research
 on food security, poverty reduction, economic development, and structural
 transformation.
 Studies on the economics of technical change in agriculture go back to
 at least 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and are reviewed in widely cited articles such as

 More recently and with the proliferation of field experiments and randomized
 controlled trials, economic theories that explore alternative drivers of
 technology adoption have received greater empirical attention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many studies (implicitly) assume that some kind of graduation model underlies
 the technical change process, wherein farmers switch from a low-level equilibri
um to a high-level equilibrium in which technology use is sustained once
 initial conditions—typically, access to information or finance—are satisfied
 or binding constraints removed

 Yet most of these studies follow farmers across a limited number of agricultura
l seasons, and are unable to fully appreciate the dynamics of technology
 adoption over time.
 Only a few studies offer a longer-term perspective, documenting significant
 levels of dis-adoption

Such a pattern of adoption and dis-adoption is consistent with a model of
 learning failures, where farmers have inflated expectations about the returns
 of a new technology but fail to uncover the true form of the production
 function through experience, leading to disappointment and subsequent dis-adopt
ion.
 Indeed, heterogeneity in farmer characteristics implies that farmers need
 to learn whether using a new technology is optimal for their specific context
 given costs and benefits

 However, learning about a new technology is often difficult for reasons

One strand of the literature argues that sequential adoption leads to experienti
al learning by farmers.
 In cases where technologies are bundled in packages, it is often observed
 that farmers sequentially adopt components of the package, rather than
 adopting the entire package at once

 argue that this occurs when farmers employ a Bayesian approach to learning
 in which they try to isolate the impact of one component of the package
 at a time.
 However, there are circumstances under which this strategy is not optimal
 because it can prevent farmers from identifying potential synergies between
 technologies, inputs, and practices.
 Indeed, the reason why many interventions are presented as a package is
 because these interaction effects are not trivial.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 find that banana tissue culture, a technology to ensure that banana plantlets
 are free from pests and diseases, leads to a seven percent yield gain in
 Kenya.
 However, they also find that improving access to irrigation can lift yield
 gains above 20 percent.
 If many complementarities like this exist, it seems unlikely that farmers
 would be in a position to follow a sequential learning path that allows
 for all possible interactions between the different technologies within
 a reasonable time frame.
 Furthermore, as mentioned above, farmers may face certain behavioral constraint
s that inhibit their ability to learn about interaction effects if, for
 example, they pay attention to minor or tangential attributes of the package
 and miss the more important attributes

 Our study contributes to this literature by providing additional evidence
 on the limits of Bayesian learning in the context of agricultural technology
 adoption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another strand of the literature addresses the technology learning process
 in terms of how farmers compare realized yields against expected yields
 to inform their subsequent adoption decisions.
 The effect of incorrect expectations about future returns on decision-making
 has largely been studied in the context of investments in education, but
 is readily applicable to technology adoption in agriculture.
 For example, both

Note that across these studies, it is assumed that the individual underestimates
 the returns in question.
 In our study, as farmers fail to appreciate the importance of complementary
 inputs, they are in a sense overestimating returns to a new technology,
 leading to over-investment in technologies, and subsequent disappointment.

Finally, the intervention we use to test our hypothesis builds on a strand
 of the literature that focuses on the role of video-mediated messaging

In the present study, we also use a video as the main conduit for information
 transfer.
 In the video presented to the treatment group, we emphasize the crucial
 role of complementary inputs and efforts in maximizing the benefits of
 improved seed varieties.
 We also show a video that promotes best practices in maize growing using
 improved seed varieties to the control group but do not explicitly point
 out the interaction with complementary inputs and efforts.
 Our study hence contributes to this literature by testing whether videos
 are also effective in conveying subtle messages.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test whether providing information about the need for additional inputs
 and practices when using improved seed varieties affects farmer behavior,
 we conduct a field experiment with almost 3,500 maize farmers in eastern
 Uganda.
 The intervention entails screening short, engaging videos about best practices
 in maize cultivation.
 The videos were shown individually to participating farmers on tablet computers
 by specially trained field enumerators.
 The content of the video scripts was developed following extensive interviews
 with experts, including agricultural extension agents, plant breeders,
 seed producers, government officials, and farmers themselves.
 In this section, we provide a detailed description of the intervention
 and the empirical strategy used to answer the research question.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Intervention
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the heart of the field experiment is a video that opens with a woman
 and a man standing in a well-kept maize plot inspecting their crop.
 The couple explains that while they have been farmers for more than ten
 years, their fields have not always been productive.
 They recount how they used to struggle to feed their children, but that
 over time, they learned how to grow more maize on less land.
 The secret to their success, the couple continues, lies in the adoption
 of improved technologies and best practices, such as the use of organic
 fertilizer, optimal plant spacing, and reduced seed rates.
 Furthermore, they explain that the use of improved seed varieties such
 as hybrid seed or open pollinated varieties (OPVs) contributed significantly
 to increased production.
 They conclude this introduction by stating that they are proud to be successful
 farmers who can feed their families and even produce surpluses to sell
 in the market.
 The viewer is then invited to become equally successful in farming by paying
 close attention as the featured (role model) farmers explain in detail
 the most important technologies, inputs, and practices that transformed
 their lives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We obtained experimental variation by recording two versions of this interventio
n video.
 The control group viewed the video as described above: it shows different
 recommended inputs and practices like row planting and inorganic fertilizer
 application but does not comment on the importance of combining them with
 improved seed varieties.
 The treatment group viewed a similar video, but now it is made explicit
 that, for each individual recommended input or practice, significant complement
arities exist when using improved varieties.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For example, in the control video, the farmer explains that: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

At planting time, I paid attention to recommended spacing, carefully measuring
 one foot between plants and 2.5 feet between rows.
 I first dug a 4-inch deep hole and added one water bottle cap of Di-Ammonium
 Phosphate (DAP).
 Then I added some soil.
 Afterwards, I put one maize seed in and covered it with soil.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 In the treatment video, the farmer narrates the same scene but adds a pointed
 comment at the end of the exposition, stating: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did you know that recommended spacing and using DAP is even more important
 when using improved seeds?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Often, we also added a few sentences that aim to correct inflated expectations.
 For instance, when discussing the use of inorganic fertilizer, we warn
 the viewer that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Improved seed are not miracle seeds! They also need proper fertilizer applicatio
n to get the higher yields.” For the practice of gap filling two weeks after
 planting, we warn: “Do not assume that just because you used an improved
 seed variety, all seeds will germinate!”

 Generally, the treatment video focuses on the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By randomizing which video is viewed by our sampled farmers, we can isolate
 the causal effect of making salient that improved varieties do not substitute
 for inputs or efforts, but in fact require more investments.
 The use of a control video has an additional advantage: since it is not
 clear to farmers or enumerators which video is the treatment and which
 is the control, we reduce the likelihood that results are driven by experimente
r demand effects 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Furthermore, to reduce the likelihood that treated participants could provide
 information to participants in the control group—a common issue in video-mediat
ed information treatments

—randomization was conducted at the village level in a manner that ensured
 reasonable geographic and social distance between villages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experiment targeted the second agricultural season of 2021, where maize
 is planted in August and September and harvested in November and December.
 We implemented the treatment in April 2021, well before the start of the
 season, to ensure that farmers had the necessary information before making
 decisions on seed and input use.
 At this point in time, we also collected baseline data.
 The intervention was repeated just before planting in August 2021, and
 post-treatment data was collected in January and February 2022.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the random assignment of participants to treatment and control groups,
 comparing outcome variable averages of treated and control participants
 provides unbiased estimates of the average treatment effects.
 We use a standard Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) regression framework
 and estimate the following equation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Y_{ij}=\alpha+\beta_{T}T_{j}+\beta_{O}\left(O_{j}-\bar{O}\right)+\beta_{X}T_{j}\left(O_{j}-\bar{O}\right)+\delta Y_{ij}^{B}+\varepsilon_{ij}\label{eq:one}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where

 is the outcome of interest (knowledge, adoption, complementary input use,

, and

\begin_inset Formula $T_{j}$
\end_inset

 is the treatment indicator, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{T}$
\end_inset

 is the parameter estimate of interest.
 Furthermore, as this study was part of a larger project with additional
 cross-randomized treatments, controls are included for the orthogonal treatment

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Standard errors are clustered at the village level, the level of randomization.
 For outcome families with more than one variable (knowledge, adoption,
 and complementary input use), we compute outcome indices to account for
 multiple hypothesis testing.
 We follow 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1198/016214508000000841"

\end_inset

, so that each index is computed as a weighted mean of the standardized
 values of the outcome variables.
 The weights are derived from the inverse covariance matrix, such that less
 weight is given to outcomes that are highly correlated with each other.
 For these indices, signs of outcomes are switched where necessary so that
 the positive direction always indicates a “better” outcome.

Sample
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The field experiment was conducted in southeastern Uganda, an area known
 for its smallholder maize production where maize is considered both a food
 and a cash crop.
 Because it was organized as part of a larger study on maize seed supply
 chains, farmers were drawn from the market-sheds of agro-input shops.
 These shops sell agricultural inputs and technologies in countries with
 large smallholder farmer populations living in remote areas with relatively
 poor infrastructure.
 A reasonably dense network of semi-formal agro-input dealers provides access
 to seeds, fertilizers, agro-chemicals, and tools, and sometimes to services
 like agricultural advisory and credit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sampling frame was developed as follows.
 First, we listed all agro-input shops in eleven districts in southeastern
 Uganda, resulting in the identification of 347 agro-input dealers.
 We then asked these dealers to identify the villages where most of their
 customers come from.
 This sampling frame allows us to assume that sampled farmers have both
 reasonable and similar access to improved maize varieties if they choose
 to adopt as a result of our intervention, and that other constraining factors
 such as seed quality, credit access, or individual preferences are similarly
 distributed across treatment and control groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, field supervisors compiled household lists for each village and ten
 maize-cultivating households per village were selected using systematic
 random sampling (nth name selection technique).
 The enumerators interviewed 3,470 farmers using a household survey instrument
 that contained a wide range of questions about the individual, their household,
 and their farm.
 From an initial sample of 3,470 farmers who were interviewed in the baseline
 survey round, only 63 farmers dropped out in the subsequent survey round.
 We did not find that attrition differed significantly between treatment
 and control group, and thus proceed with the analysis on a balanced panel
 of 3,407 farmers.
 Since we have more than 3,400 observations in about 350 clusters, we use
 the original form of the sandwich estimator

 provides descriptive statistics from the baseline farmer survey.
 The first column reports sample means (and standard deviations below).
 For example, we see that household heads are 49 years old on average, and
 that 78 percent are male.
 The average household consists of almost nine members and uses 3.3 acres
 of land for crop production.
 About half of the farmers in our sample indicate that they used seed of
 an improved maize variety (OPV or hybrid) on at least one plot in the season
 preceding the baseline survey, and 33 percent bought this seed at an agro-input
 shop.
 We further asked farmers to rate the general quality of the maize seed
 they planted in the previous season on a scale of one (poor) to five (excellent
) and see that they rate it fairly high (3.4 out of 5).
 Organic fertilizer use at baseline is very low and the average farmer harvested
 500 kg of maize per acre.
 About half of the farmers in our sample also sold maize.

Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 also serves to demonstrate baseline balance on a set of pre-registered
 variables.
 The second column shows the differences between treatment and control group
 means (and standard errors below—they are clustered at the village level).
 We find only one significant difference (at the 10-percent significance
 level) which is expected when ten comparisons are made, hence we conclude
 that the randomization was successful.

 summarizes the impact of the intervention on four families of outcomes:
 farmer knowledge about the importance of using complementary inputs and

 use of complementary inputs and good agronomic practices, and a measure
 of how well expected maize yields align with realized yields on the farmer's
 field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We test farmer knowledge about the importance of using complementary inputs
 and practices through a short quiz where enumerators asked a number of

 Indeed, when we set up the experiment, we did not intend to reduce the
 adoption of seed of improved varieties.

Next, we introduce farmer heterogeneity in the beliefs they hold about the
 relationship between yield obtained from using seed of an improved variety
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(Y_{it+1}^{H}\right)$
\end_inset

 and the inputs needed to realize this yield 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(X_{it}\right)$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A first group of farmers—also referred to as type 1 farmers below—knows
 that, for the adoption premium to materialize, additional complementary
 inputs and practices are needed.
 These farmers will adopt if the value of the expected adoption premium
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(E\left(p_{t+1}A_{i}\left(X_{it}^{H}>X_{it}^{L}\right)\right)\right)$
\end_inset

 exceeds the cost of the seed and additional complementary inputs needed
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\sum w_{t}X_{it}^{H}-\sum w_{t}X_{it}^{L}+b_{t}s_{it}\right)$
\end_inset

 Informing these farmers about the true shape of the production function
 will not have an effect on adoption of improved seed, or any other outcome
 we consider in Figure

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second group of farmers—also referred to as type 2 farmers below—thinks
 that the adoption premium is not dependent on the use of complementary
 inputs and practices.
 They believe that the adoption premium is always present 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(Y_{it+1}^{H}=A_{i}+Y_{it}\left(X_{it}\right)\right)$
\end_inset

.
 These farmers will use the same inputs for both varieties (hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum w_{t}X_{it}^{H}=\sum w_{t}X_{it}^{L}$
\end_inset

) and adopt if the value of the (misspecified) expected adoption premium
 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(p_{t+1}A_{i}\right)$
\end_inset

 exceeds the cost of seed 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(b_{t}s_{it}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Informing this group of farmers about the need for complementary inputs
 will presumably reduce the likelihood of adoption, as it increases the
 cost of obtaining the premium by the cost of the additional complementary
 inputs 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\sum w_{t}X_{it}^{H}-\sum w_{t}X_{it}^{L}\right)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Only if the misspecified adoption premium is large enough (i.e., exceeding
 the cost of additional complementary inputs needed (including the seed
 and normalized by the price)), type 2 farmers who adopted will also adopt
 after having been informed about the need to use complementary inputs.
 As such, the average treatment effect does not only depend on the share
 of farmers who hold correct or incorrect beliefs, but also on the technology
 and associated costs.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 For these farmers, we thus expect a positive effect of the intervention
 on knowledge and a negative effect on adoption.
 Furthermore, we do not expect a change in the use of complementary inputs
 and practices.
 We expect that farmers' expectations become more in line with reality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A third group of farmers—also referred to as type 3 farmers below—also use
 misspecified mental models of the production function.
 This group of farmers does not believe that seed of an improved variety
 is any better than local seed, hence 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{it+1}^{H}=Y_{it}\left(X_{it}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This could be farmers who used to believe in miracle seeds, but after a
 negative experience with improved seed (either through own experimentation
 or through learning from peers) adjusted their expectations downward.
 Informing this group of farmers about the need for complementary inputs
 could increase the likelihood of adoption if they update their beliefs
 and, after doing so, the expected adoption premium 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(p_{t+1}A_{i}\left(X_{it}^{H}>X_{it}^{L}\right)\right)$
\end_inset

 exceeds the cost of the seed and additional complementary inputs needed
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\sum w_{t}X_{it}^{H}-\sum w_{t}X_{it}^{L}+b_{t}s_{it}\right)$
\end_inset

 For these farmers, we would expect an increase in knowledge, an increase
 in adoption, and an increase in the use of complementary inputs and practices.
 For this group of farmers, we do not expect a change in expectations.

This is because virtually all these farmers will be using local seed in

s.
 In particular, we condition on two variables.
 First, we attempt to remove farmers who already use complementary inputs
 from our sample, as we do not expect an effect for these farmers (which
 would be in the first group in our model of Section

One challenge with this strategy is that there are different complementary
 inputs and practices and some farmers may adopt some while not adopting
 others.
 As such, it is not immediately clear which complementary inputs should
 be selected to condition on.
 To deal with this, we created an index of the ten inputs and practices
 that are featured in the video (and measured at baseline; these are also
 considered as outcomes in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Impact-on-use"
plural "false"

 when measured at endline).
 The index is again computed according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1198/016214508000000841"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and weighs its components by the inverse variance covariance matrix.
 As the components are standardized, the index is on average approximately
 zero, and so we simply define adopters of complementary inputs and practices
 as farmers that have a baseline index above zero.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This leads to a more homogeneous subsample of individuals who are potentially
 responsive to the treatment and an effect size that is not diluted due
 to the presence of non-responders' outcomes—considering the entire sample
 brings the treatment group's average closer to the control group's average.

 We do this by looking at the distribution of expected maize yields at baseline.
 Farmers in the lowest 33 percent of the distribution are categorized as
 potentially underestimating the yield premium, while farmers in the highest
 33 percent of the distribution are categorized as potentially overestimating
 the yield premium.
 The remainder is assumed to correctly estimate the yield premium.

 According to our model in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Theoretical-framework"

\end_inset

, we expect a positive effect of the treatment on farmers' knowledge, and
 this effect should become increasingly stronger when farmers who use complement
ary inputs are removed from the sample and when we zoom in on farmers that
 are likely to overestimate yields.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As indicated above, we test farmer knowledge using a short quiz.
 The quiz begins with a general question asking farmers whether they think
 recommended cultivation practices like weeding and fertilizer application
 are (1) less, (2) equally, or (3) more important when using improved varieties.
 This is followed by a more specific multiple-choice question on a particular
 practice—weeding—when cultivating an improved variety.
 Response options are: (1) you do not need to weed because seed of improved
 varieties is treated to resist weed infestation; (2) you do not need to
 weed in the first four weeks because seed of improved varieties is better
 at competing for sun, nutrients, and water than normal seed; and (3) you
 need to weed just as you would with unimproved varieties because maize
 seed does not compete well for sunlight, water, and nutrients.
 The quiz contains a similar question about a key input as well—fertilizer—when
 cultivating an improved variety.
 The options here are: (1) you do not need to use inorganic fertilizer because
 you already purchased seed; (2) you can use less fertilizer than you normally
 would since seed of an improved maize variety grows faster; (3) you need
 to use the amount of fertilizer that you would with unimproved varieties
 because seed of an improved variety also needs nutrition; and (4) you should
 use more fertilizer than you would normally use.
 We also combine all outcomes in an overall index following

 Column (1) provides the means in the control group (with standard deviations
 in brackets below), mainly to get an idea of effect sizes.
 We see that knowledge is already high, which is likely to reduce statistical
 power for these comparisons.
 For example, 36 percent of farmers in the control group know that recommended
 inputs and cultivation practices like weeding or applying fertilizer are
 even more important when using improved varieties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Column (2) shows the estimated difference between the treatment and control
 groups for outcomes after the intervention on the entire sample.
 Column (3) also reports this difference, but in the more homogeneous subset
 of farmers who did not already use complementary inputs and good agronomic
 practices at baseline.
 Finally, column (4) further reduces the sample to only those that overestimate
 yields in an attempt to isolate the second group of farmers in our model
 of Section

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that the treatment generally increases the likelihood that farmers
 answer correctly.
 However, the difference is only significant for the individual question
 about the use of fertilizer.
 This could be because the recognition that complementary inputs are necessary
 to reap the benefits of improved seed may become more salient when this
 complementary input comes at a substantial pecuniary cost.
 Effect sizes become larger with increasingly specific samples, as expected.

Impact on Adoption

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now turn to the main hypothesis of this paper: whether farmers who were
 told that improved varieties need substantial investment in complementary
 inputs and management practices behave differently in terms of seed use
 in subsequent seasons than farmers who were not similarly informed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, we determine if farmers adopted improved maize varieties.
 To do so, we asked farmers on how many plots they cultivated maize during
 the preceding season.
 From these plots, we randomly selected one plot and asked detailed questions
 about seed and varietal use, input use, and management practices.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The decision to ask detailed questions on only one (randomly selected) plot
 as opposed to asking details on all plots was made because there is generally
 high correlation between technology use, input use, and management practices
 within a household.
 As such, we decided to increase the number of farmers at the expense of
 the number of plots as this would increase statistical power.
 That said, one may be worried that farmers use different seed on different
 plots, and if the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wrong
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 plot is chosen, a farmer that is actually an adopting farmer is categorized
 as a non-adopter.
 We investigated this issue further by using a different variable for adoption
 status, namely if the farmer used seed of an improved variety on any field,
 and results were very similar.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Based on the information collected, we then defined a farmer as an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Adopter
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if they used either non-recycled (newly purchased, not saved) seed of either
 a hybrid or an open-pollinated variety.
 All others were defined as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Non-adopters.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We acknowledge that this definition of adoption is not perfect.
 Seed of an OPV that has been recycled (saved) up to four times could still
 be considered improved, and farmers using this seed could still be counted
 as adopters.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 A second related outcome we consider is the use of recycled seed, which
 is defined as seed that farmers have saved themselves or obtained from
 other farmers who saved it (for example, neighbors or relatives).
 A third related outcome is the share of farmers who report having purchased
 seed from an agro-input shop.
 We also combine all outcomes in an overall index following

 Similar to Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:knowledge"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, column (1) shows the sample means of the outcomes at baseline with standard
 deviations in the brackets below.
 We find that 44 percent of farmers use fresh seed of improved varieties,
 and one third reports that the seed that they planted on the randomly selected
 plot was obtained from an agro-input dealer.
 Column (2) shows the difference between treatment and control groups for
 outcomes after the intervention.
 Our theory suggests that in response to being sensitized about the importance
 of using complementary inputs and management practices when using an improved
 variety, some farmers will change their adoption behavior (the second and
 third group in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Theoretical-framework"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 A relatively large share of farmers who initially overestimated the probability
 of an adoption premium (the second group) may not adopt as their expected
 marginal return is reduced by the treatment.
 A share of farmers who initially underestimated the returns to improved
 varieties (the third group) may adopt if they decided adopting is profitable
 after updating their beliefs and comparing costs to benefits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "section: Results"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we showed that adoption, as measured by the index, significantly decreases
 as a result of the treatment.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Treatment-effects"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 further shows that this is driven by a lower likelihood that the farmer
 plants seed of an improved variety.
 Reducing the sample to a more homogeneous sample of farmers who did not
 already use complementary inputs and good agronomic practices at baseline
 increases the effect size, albeit only marginally, see column (3).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our model of Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Theoretical-framework"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 reveals that differences in expected yields (farmer types 2 and 3) may
 lead to opposing effects of the treatment on adoption, which is likely
 to mute the overall effect.
 To separate the two opposing effects, we further restrict the sample to
 farmers who overestimate the adoption premium in column (4).
 Consistent with model predictions, we find that after doing so, the negative
 effect on adoption becomes much stronger.
 Type 2 farmers who were exposed to the treatment are thirteen percentage
 points less likely to adopt fresh seed of an improved variety.
 This is matched by an increase in the share of farmers that uses seed recycled
 from the previous harvest in the treatment group.
 We also find an almost ten percent reduction in farmers who bought seed
 from an agro-input dealer.
 Results thus indicate that in the subgroup of farmers with inflated yield
 expectations, the intervention induces farmers to turn away from improved
 seed varieties toward local low-cost, low-yielding alternatives.

Impact on Use of Inputs and Practices
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:Impact-on-use"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we investigate how the intervention affects the use of inputs (other
 than seed) and practices.
 Recall from our theoretical model in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Theoretical-framework"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 that we expect a positive impact, but only for a particular subgroup, so
 the overall effect is likely to be muted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We examine a range of cultivation practices and complementary inputs in
 line with what is featured in both treatment and control videos.
 The first outcome is an indicator for single–stand row planting.
 Row planting is an important management practice that can lead to significant
 yield gains.
 Under row planting, space is used optimally such that plants have sufficient
 nutrients, sunlight, and room to grow.
 However, row planting increases workload.
 Reducing the seeding rate (i.e., the number of seeds sown) is the second
 outcome of interest.
 Farmers often plant more seed than necessary because they fear that it
 may not germinate.
 However, using more than two seeds per hill leads to stunted maize growth
 due to competition for light and nutrients.
 At the same time, just as for row planting, a lower seed rate may increase
 the workload because farmers need to engage in gap filling after one week
 if seeds fail to germinate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next three outcomes relate to fertilizer use.
 The application of organic fertilizer is important for soil structure,
 while inorganic fertilizers such as diammonium phosphate (DAP) or nitrogen,
 phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) and urea (nitrogen) are used to provide
 essential nutrients at particular points in time.
 The cost of organic fertilizer is mainly in terms of labor, whereas both
 DAP and urea need to be bought from an agro-input shop and applied during
 planting (DAP) and at early stages of growth (urea).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Farmers should weed within the first week after planting.
 Official recommendations are to weed at least three times per seasons.
 Furthermore, invasive insects such as the fall armyworm (
\emph on
Spodoptera frugiperda
\emph default
) or maize stalk borer (
\emph on
Busseola fusca
\emph default
) can severely reduce yields.
 Herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides are widely available in agro-input
 shops under commercial names such as Rocket, Lalafos, and Dudu acelamectin.
 While weeding requires labor, pesticides come at a pecuniary cost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we look at differences in re-sowing or gap-filling.
 This involves revisiting the plot after planting and inspecting the hills
 for seed germination.
 If a seed does not germinate, a new seed is planted in that location.
 Re-sowing, reduced seed rate, and row-planting are thus likely to be correlated.
 We also combine all outcomes in an overall index following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 As in previous tables, column (1) reports means and standard deviations
 for outcomes at baseline.
 Column (2) shows that farmers do not invest more inputs or efforts in response
 to the intervention.
 In column (3), we confine attention to farmers who did not use complementary
 inputs and practices at baseline, which does not affect findings, except
 for the fact that the negative effect on row planting becomes stronger.
 Finally, in column (4), we isolate the effect on type 2 farmers and, as
 expected, we establish a null effect.
 Overall, the finding of no impact of the intervention on the use of inputs
 and practices suggests that type 2 farmers dominate in our sample.

 met on the randomly selected maize plot.

 Column (1) reports control group means and standard deviations as we did

 Note that a large majority of farmers indicated that expectations were
 not met.
 Column (2) shows that yield expectations have been significantly affected
 by the intervention, albeit only at the 10-percent level.
 The share of farmers who indicate that expectations were in line with realized
 outcomes increases to almost five percentage points if we zoom in on type
 2 farmers, but the effect is not significantly different from zero (probably
 due to the reduced sample size).
 Taken together, this provides suggestive evidence that a subset of farmers
 indeed started out with inflated expectations, which were corrected after
 they learned that improved varieties are not

\begin_layout Standard
This paper was motivated by the observation that farmers often seem to be
 unaware that many agricultural technologies such as improved seed varieties
 require substantial complementary inputs, better management practices,
 and greater effort for their benefits to realize.
 In a sense, farmers thus overestimate the returns to a technology and may
 be disappointed when they compare expectations to actual yields.
 Because learning about a new technology is hard, farmers may attribute
 the disappointing results to the technology itself and refrain from adopting
 in subsequent seasons.
 This is consistent with findings suggesting that farmers blame poor returns
 on inputs they believe to be counterfeit or of low quality even when objective
 quality assessments show otherwise

\begin_layout Standard
To test the hypothesis that farmers think of improved varieties as

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 we conducted a field experiment built around a short, engaging video on
 recommended input use and management practices for maize cultivation in
 eastern Uganda.
 More in particular, we produced two versions of the video that differ only
 in terms of the presence of explicit messaging about the importance of
 using complementary inputs like fertilizers and practices such as weeding
 when using improved seed.
 Screenings of the two versions were randomly assigned to villages in our
 study area, and then to maize farmers in those villages, resulting in a
 sample of almost 3,500 farmers who were interviewed before and after the
 intervention to uncover any changes in their knowledge about best practices
 in maize cultivation as well as their seed or variety choices, their yield
 expectations, and their use of complementary inputs and management practices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that sensitizing farmers about the fact that improved seed varieties
 require substantial complementary inputs and practices to obtain yield
 benefits increases their knowledge and brings their expectations more in
 line with realized outcomes.
 However, somewhat paradoxically, we find that the treatment led to a reduction
 in the adoption of seed of a new variety and had no effect on the use of
 complementary inputs and practices.
 We rationalize this finding through a model that features a heterogeneous
 response to the treatment caused by differences in ex-ante beliefs about
 the production function.
 Type 1 farmers understand the true shape of the production function and
 the treatment will not affect their behavior.
 Type 2 farmers have inflated expectations about the yield gains from improved
 seed, and the intervention reduces these expected benefits (or equivalently
 raises the cost of obtaining these benefits).
 For these farmers, our model predicts a negative effect on adoption.
 Type 3 farmers do not believe that improved seed performs better than normal
 seed.
 Correcting this false belief may induce at least some farmers to start
 adopting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that the negative effect on adoption outweighs a positive impact,
 which seems reasonable in the Ugandan context.
 First, it is likely that the share of type 2 farmers is larger than the
 share of type 3 farmers.
 Low adoption rates in the study population imply limited opportunities
 to become disappointed and switch from believing in miracle seeds to believing
 that improved seed does not work.
 Second, even if type 2 farmers tried out seed without complementary inputs
 and experienced a disappointing outcome, they may not always adjust expectation
s and become type 3 farmers.
 Indeed, learning about a new technology from own experimentation is hard
 (given the many stochastic processes that enter a production function like
 weather events, pests, and diseases) and farmers may attribute a disappointing
 outcome to a bad draw from a good distribution (and they keep believing
 in miracle seeds).
 Third, the net treatment effect also depends on the nature of the production
 function.
 Indeed, as we saw in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Theoretical-framework"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, type 3 farmers will only adopt if the updated beliefs about the adoption
 premium exceed the cost of the seed and additional complementary inputs
 needed.
 Given the high cost of complementary inputs in the context of potentially
 resource constrained farmers, the share of farmers who begins to adopt
 due to the treatment is likely to be small.

Our results differ from other studies that find that improved technologies
 increase agricultural productivity by crowding in modern inputs and cultivation
 practices

 provided the improved technology (also an improved seed variety) for free
 as part of the experiment, potentially resulting in an income effect, i.e.,
 the money that treated farmers did

 do discuss the possibility that their effects are driven by an income effect.
 However, in the presence of an income effect, they understand the effect
 of the additional income resulting from the adoption of the technology
 (a flood-tolerant rice variety).
 The income effect we are concerned about is one that results from farmers
 receiving seed for free, potentially freeing up money for other investments.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In our experiment, no free seed was provided, so when adoption decisions
 were made, farmers had to take the combined cost of seed 
\shape italic
and
\shape default
 cost of complementary inputs into account, further eroding the expected
 profitability of the improved technology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our findings have implications for the understanding of technology adoption
 dynamics.
 If disappointment about the performance of a technology is erroneously
 attributed to the technology itself and this learning failure is not corrected—
for instance, by pointing out that the seed is good and that the problem
 is the lack of complementary input use—farmers potentially move into long
 periods of consistent under-adoption even if adoption would be profitable
 for them.

Note that new varieties are introduced now and then, and extension workers
 and successful neighbors may convince farmers to try again.
 So, farmers are likely to adopt again after some seasons but generally
 only to be disappointed again if they are still not aware about the importance
 of complementary inputs and practices.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Furthermore, as negative experiences tend to stick more and negative news
 may travel faster, exaggerated expectations and subsequent dis-adoption
 may further complicate (social) learning 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ledgerwood2014sticky,HORNIK2015273"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 All this is likely to lead to lower than optimal adoption in the aggregate.
 Informing farmers about the need for complementary inputs up front can
 save them from the disappointment and financial loss of failed attempts.
 Additionally, correcting beliefs may prompt some of these disappointed
 farmers to re-evaluate costs and benefits of using improved seed, which
 may increase adoption in the long run.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our study also casts some doubt on the suggestion that Bayesian learning
 via sequential adoption can be a successful strategy for smallholder farmers
 in the long run

.
 If there are important interaction effects between technologies, inputs,
 and practices, it seems unreasonable to assume that farmers are able to
 try out all possible combinations of inputs to learn about these interactions
 in a Bayesian fashion, at least within a reasonable time frame.
 This suggests an important role for agricultural extension and advisory
 services when introducing new technologies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our findings also have implications for how public and private actors in
 the agriculture sector should promote new technologies.
 If smallholders' information sources such as private input dealers and
 public extension agents are not sufficiently able to communicate the importance
 of complementary inputs and practices, this will result in sub-optimal
 levels of adoption due to the learning errors described above.
 Worse, if smallholders have incorrect perceptions about poor quality caused
 by misattribution, the persistence of these perceptions may crowd out the
 market for quality inputs

 And while the distribution of free or subsidized technologies and inputs
 may in part encourage farmers' learning processes and

 their perceptions (for example, with unique standalone technologies,

 are not part of the package, which may again lead to disappointment among
 farmers.
 Thus, our findings suggest that agricultural development programs, extension
 providers, and agri-input companies need to focus less on marketing single

 of comprehensive packages that include both agronomic and economic information
 on topics such as expected variation in yield and output, sensitivity of
 timing for specific farming tasks, magnitude and costs of family and hired
 labor, and the relative drudgery of effort, among many others.
