Miracle Seed: Biased Expectations, Complementary Input Use, and the Dynamics
 of Smallholder Technology Adoption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Farmers that try out agricultural technologies, such as improved seed varieties
 obtained from agro-input dealers, may hold unrealistic expectations about
 these technologies.
 The fact that they paid a significant price for certain traits of the technolog
y, such as higher yield or pest resistance, may lead them to invest less
 in complementary inputs such as fertilizers or pesticides and reduce management
 practices such as weeding.
 Subsequent disappointment about the performance of the technology may then
 be erroneously attributed to the technology itself, resulting in dis-adoption.
 We provide a simple model of technology adoption and test its predictions
 using a field experiment among 3,500 smallholder maize farmers in Uganda.
 In the experiment, a treatment group gets explicit information on the importanc
e of combining improved technologies and recommended farming practices.
 We find some evidence that in the short run, our message scares farmers
 away from commercial seed, back to local farmer-saved seed.
 There is further suggestive evidence that at least some farmers adjust
 expectations and move back into adoption in the longer run.
 We conclude that policy makers and industry should focus on technology
 adoption as a package of complementary inputs and efforts, instead of marketing
 a single technology.

To feed a growing population in a sustainable way, farmers throughout the
 developing world will have to grow more food on less land

 To achieve this objective, much is expected from new technologies, especially
 from higher yielding cultivars

 At the same time, agricultural production will become more challenging
 due to the climate crisis.
 Also in this context, seed varieties that are selected to be more resilient
 against droughts and diseases are thought to be at least part of the solution

Unfortunately, the adoption of such technologies is lagging in areas where
 it has the largest potential.

 progress has stagnated on the continent

 Significant heterogeneity underlies this general stagnation.
 For instance, at the micro level, we often observe dis-adoption, where
 farmers choose to switch back to technologies they have been using for
 decades after trying out a new technology once or twice

\begin_layout Standard
There are many reasons why farmers do not move into a state of consistent
 adoption.
 An obvious one is that the inputs that some farmers previously used simply
 become unavailable

 for them or does not meet their expectations

 result in dis-adoption

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we consider the possibility that farmers hold inflated expectatio
ns of inputs as an explanation for their dis-adoption.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Over the years, we uncovered many anecdotes in a variety of contexts that
 point to this explanation.
 For instance, many farmers use (inorganic) fertilizer once and assume this
 will lead to lasting improvements in soil fertility.
 However, these fertilizers need to be applied in each cropping cycle to
 be effective.
 In the context of seed, extension officers often complain that farmers
 consider the trial seed packs they provide as some kind of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

miracle seed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which they can just broadcast on their least fertile plots without further
 management and still get exceptional harvests.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 These inflated expectations have their origin in the fact that monetary
 outlays are necessary for improved technologies, and farmers may consider
 this as a signal that modern inputs are substitutes for other investments
 they would typically make.
 In reality, however, for improved technologies to reach their full potential,
 equal or even additional complementary investments are necessary.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "https://doi.org/10.1111/agec.12721"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 show that farming with hybrid seed is far more costly than farming with
 traditional seed.
 The extra production costs include the cost of seed, but also fertilizer
 costs as hybrid farming requires more chemical fertilizers to achieve significa
nt yield improvements, and (hired) labor and land preparation costs as hybrid
 farming again requires more specific and complex cultivation techniques.
 Inflated expectations about the performance of improved technologies can
 have lasting impacts on adoption if farmers attribute poor outcomes to
 the technology, instead of to the reduced use of complementary inputs and
 effort.
 This learning failure is understandable: as many factors simultaneously
 affect yields, learning about the causal impact of a new technology from
 a single experience is difficult, and cognitive constrained farmers may
 pay attention to the wrong attributes

 that they think they can just broadcast on their least fertile plots without
 further management and still get exceptional harvests.
 However, improved maize seed needs a lot of fertilizer, often leaving soil
 more depleted than when farmer-saved seed is used.
 In the areas where our research is situated, striga (
\emph on
striga hermonthica
\emph default
), a parasitic weed that feeds on the roots of maize plants and cause stunted
 growth, is a serious problem.
 Unfortunately, striga proliferates in poor soils and as a result some farmers
 now believe that improved seed varieties are responsible for increased
 striga infestations on their fields.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We present a simple model of technology adoption that incorporates the above
 ideas.
 In this model, budget constrained farmers compare expected returns of an
 improved technology to business-as-usual.
 The new technology comes at a cost, while the traditional technology does
 not.
 Both technologies, though, require complementary inputs and efforts that
 directly affect productivity, yet for farmers that experiment with the
 new technology, this technology is considered to be a substitute for some
 of the other inputs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We test the predictions of the model using a field experiment among 3500
 maize farmers in eastern Uganda.
 At the heart of the field experiment is a light-touch information intervention
 that attempts to correct the perception that the improved technology is
 a substitute for other inputs and efforts.
 In particular, we show all farmers in our sample a short engaging video
 about the use of improved agro-inputs and recommended management practices
 for maize growing.
 In the treatment group we essentially show the same video, except that
 in certain parts—for instance when the use of inorganic fertilizers is
 demonstrated or when weeding is explained—we highlight that it remains
 important to use additional inputs and to perform management practices
 when using improved seed varieties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start with testing if farmers are able to extract the relevant information
 from the treatment video by testing knowledge after two full seasons post
 intervention.
 We find some indications that in the treatment group more farmers are aware
 of the importance of combining inputs than in the control group.
 Turning to adoption behavior, we see that farmers in the treatment group
 are more likely to use seed saved from the previous season.
 If we confine attention to only farmers that adopted at baseline, we see
 that farmers that were exposed to the treatment video were also less likely
 to obtain seed from agro-input dealers, more likely to use farmer-saved
 seed, and less likely to use improved seed varieties such as hybrids or
 Open Pollinated Varieties (OPV).
 However, in the subsequent season, these differences between treatment
 and control groups have disappeared.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then look at some secondary outcomes to explore mechanisms at work behind
 the intervention.
 First, we test if the intervention has an effect on the use of complementary
 inputs such as fertilizer and pesticides, as well as on best practices
 in crop management such as row planting and weeding.
 We would have expected a positive impact here, at least in the longer run
 when farmers are given sufficient time realign their production decisions
 to the new knowledge, but we do not; statistical power may be an issue.
 Second, even in the absence of adjustments in complementary input use and
 practices, the intervention may still have lasting impacts if farmers'
 expectations become more realistic, and we do see that a larger share of
 farmers in the treatment group report that yields are what they expected
 than in the control group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our work has important implications for both public and private sector stakehold
ers.
 The main conclusion is that a more holistic approach is necessary when
 encouraging varietal turnover and adoption of improved seed varieties by
 smallholder farmers.
 Governments should provide (free or subsidized) innovation packages that
 include complementary inputs as well, instead of focusing on a single technolog
y such as seed trial packs.
 Agricultural advisory services should manage expectations of farmers with
 respect to modern agricultural inputs.
 Agro-input dealers should be careful when marketing individual products
 for a particular trait if their aim is to build a loyal customer base.

 theories related to technology adoption have been subject to the scrutiny
 of randomized controlled trials, often under the auspices of the Agricultural
 Technology Adoption Initiative, a collaboration between the Abdul Latif

Studies about technology adoption often (implicitly) assume some kind of
 graduation model, where farmers switch to a high level equilibrium of sustained
 adoption once initial conditions, in terms of for instance access to informatio
n or access to finance, are satisfied

 Especially in applied micro-economic field experiments, researchers focus
 on a limited number of agricultural seasons, and are unable to fully appreciate
 the dynamics of technology adoption.
 However, a number of studies document significant levels of dis-adoption

 is a learning failure that leads to dis-adoption.
 Indeed, heterogeneity in farmer characteristics implies that farmers need
 to learn if a technology is suitable for their specific case 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Generally, farmers learn through a combination of own experiences and observing
 others 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "foster1995learning"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, learning about a new technology is hard.
 Based on observable characteristics, it is often difficult to determine
 what the quality of an input is before using it.
 Some even argue that many technologies are credence goods 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2018.1464143"

 because their evaluation is also hard ex-post, as many factors, including
 some that are out of the control of the farmer such as weather conditions
 and pests, affect outcomes

One strand of the literature argues that sequential adoption leads to experienti
al learning by farmers.
 In cases where technologies are bundled in packages, it is often observed
 that farmers sequentially adopt components of the package, rather than
 the entire package

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 argue that this is due to farmers employing a Bayesian approach to learning,
 where they try to isolate the impact of one component of the package.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, there are circumstances under which this strategy is not optimal
 because it does not allow farmers to identify potential interaction effects
 between the inputs.
 Indeed, the reason why interventions are presented as a package often means
 that these interaction effects are not trivial.
 For instance,

 find that banana tissue culture, a technology to ensure that banana plantlets
 are free from pests and diseases, leads to a seven percent yield gain in
 Kenya.
 However, they also find that improving access to irrigation could lift
 yield gains above 20 percent.
 It seems unlikely that farmers follow a sequential learning path that allows
 for all possible interactions between the different technologies.
 Furthermore, behavioral constrains may prevent farmers from effective learning.
 It is for instance possible that farmers pay attention to the wrong attributes

When learning about a new technology, farmers will ex-post compare realized
 yields to the yields they expected at the time they made the decision to
 adopt.
 This information will then be used in subsequent adoption.
 The effect of expectation about future returns on a decision has been studied
 in the context of education.
 Both

 finds that a video intervention that informs farmers about the returns
 on intensification investments in rice growing increased adoption in Uganda.
 In all these studies, it is assumed that expected returns are underestimated.
 In the present study, we expect the reverse: Farmers consider improved
 seed to be miracle seed and thus overestimate returns, leading to too much
 investment.
 Correcting these believes is expected to lead to less adoption in the short
 run, but more stable adoption for part of the farmer population in the
 long run.

Finally, our treatment comes in the form of short and engaging videos.
 There is a large literature that shows video can be an important vehicle

 in the present study were performing significantly better on a knowledge
 test, were more likely to apply recommended practices and fertilizer than
 households that did not view the video.
 These same households also reported maize yields 10.5 percent higher than
 the ones of the control group.
 Our study also contributes to this literature as it tests if a video is
 effective in transmitting subtle information.

We model the decision to adopt as a binary process, where farmers adopt
 on entire fields, instead of expressing 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{it}$

in kilograms of seed used.
 As such, 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{t}$
\end_inset

 refers to the cost of planting an entire field with improved seed varieties.

Equation

 shows that adoption decisions based on profit functions fundamentally depend
 on yield comparisons.
 We assume that yield for farmer-saved seed is a function of inputs used:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Y_{it+1}^{L}=Y_{it}\left(X_{it}^{L}\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and this relationship is assumed to be positive with decreasing returns
 to scale: 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dY_{it}}{dX_{it}}>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{d^{2}Y_{it}}{dX_{it}^{2}}<0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yield for improved seed follows a similar function as yield for farmer-saved
 seed, but adds a positive and constant adoption premium 
\begin_inset Formula $(A>0)$
\end_inset

.
 However, the adoption premium only applies when the farmer uses at least
 the same amount of complementary inputs as they would do when using farmer-save
d seed 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{it}^{H}\geq X_{it}^{L}$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Y_{it+1}^{H}=A\left(X_{it}^{H}\geq X_{it}^{L}\right)+Y_{it}^{L}\label{eq:truerel}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

However, there may be reasons why farmers reduce input use when adopting
 improved seed.
 For instance, if they face a budget constrained, then inputs will be reduced
 by the cost of seed, resulting in lower yields

 improved and farmer-saved seed, on the relative prices of the inputs, and

 We introduce farmer heterogeneity into the model by assuming that at least

 Providing information about the true relationship between

\begin_inset Formula $X_{it}$

 does adopt prior to the intervention because their marginal cost of adoption
 is lower than their expected marginal returns.
 Providing these type 3 farmers with information may lead them to dis-adopt,
 at least in the short run, when this new information reduces their expected
 marginal return below the marginal cost.
 As these farmers stop adopting improved varieties and start using cheaper
 farmer-saved seed, their yield expectations will also become more in line
 with reality.

Unclear and not really necessary - consider deleting: Correct expectations
 are defined as the farmer harvesting as much maize from their field as

 If a farmer plants improved seed, these expectations deal with the yield

 If a farmer plants local seed, these expectations deal with the yield of
 local seed.
 In fact, we assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(Y_{it}^{L}\right)=Y_{it}^{L}$
\end_inset

As type 3 farmers dis-adopt, we do not expect an impact on efforts in response

 Providing these farmers with information will not have an effect on their
 adoption decision because it will only decrease their expected marginal
 return which was already too low to adopt prior to the intervention.
 As they were already planting local seed, their expectations will also
 not be affected by the intervention, nor do we expect an effect on their
 efforts.

 of adoption, even if they underestimate the probability of realizing an
 adoption premium.
 These farmers keep adopting as the intervention increases their expected
 marginal return, but they may adjust their efforts and expectations in
 response to the treatment.
 For another fraction of farmers that underestimate the adoption premium,
 referred to as type 6 in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "types of farmers"
plural "false"

 adoption, so that they do not adopt prior to the intervention.
 However, as the intervention increases their expectation of the return,
 they may start adopting in response to the treatment and also invest more
 efforts.
 There will be no impact on expectations because the type 6 farmers do not
 adopt at baseline and therefore have correct expectations about their yield
 prior to the intervention.

\begin_layout Enumerate
Some farmers that acquire new information related to the interaction effects
 between improved seed varieties and complementary inputs (types 3 and 6)
 will change their adoption behavior.
 The effect on adoption in the next season could be positive or negative,
 depending on how many farmers can be categorized as type 3 and type 6.
 If there are more type 3 than type 6 farmers, the effect on adoption will
 be negative.
 If there are less type 3 than type 6 farmers, the effect on adoption will
 be positive.
 However, it is likely that these two opposing effects cancel each other
 out.
 If we only consider farmers that adopt at baseline, the effect on adoption
 will be negative as this excludes type 6 farmers from the analysis.

 Yes, this will be endogenous but I still think it would be more useful

Study population

\begin_layout Standard
The field experiment was implemented in eastern Uganda, an area know for
 its maize production.
 Maize is considered both a food and cash crop in that area.
 As a matter of fact, much of the maize that is used as food aid in Sudan
 is sourced from here.
 As this study was part of a larger study that involved seed supply chains,
 smallholder farmers were drawn from the catchment areas of agro input dealers.
 As such, farmers should have reasonable access to improved seed varieties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Baseline data was collected from dealers in September and October 2020 and
 from farmers in April 2021.
 Midline data was collected in January and February 2022, and endline data
 was collected in July and August 2022.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The treatment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The treatment was implemented using short, engaging videos, shown to the
 farmers on tablet computers.
 Based on extensive interviews with experts, we developed a script that
 served as a basis for a video about best practices in maize cultivation.
 The video starts off with a couple (man and woman) in a healthy maize field
 inspecting their crops.
 The man narrates that they have been farmers for more than ten years but
 that their fields have not always been this productive.
 He recounts how they used to struggle to feed their children, but that
 over time, they learned how to grow more maize.
 The secret of their success, they continue, lies in the adoption of improved
 technologies and best practices, such as the use of organic fertilizer,
 and optimal plant spacing and reduced seed rates.
 Furthermore, they argue that the use of improved seed and fertilizer also
 contributed significantly to increased production.
 They conclude this introduction by stating that they are proud to be successful
 farmers that can feed their families and even have some marketable surplus
 that they can sell on the market.
 The viewer is then invited to become a successful farmer as well by paying
 close attention as the role model farmers explain in detail the most important
 inputs and practices that transformed their lives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The treatment was implemented in the form of two variations of this video.
 The control video is essentially the video as described above.
 In the treatment video, we added subtle messages that recommended practices
 and inputs that feature in the video are particularly important when the
 farmer uses improved seed varieties.
 The only difference between the treatment and control video is thus that
 the former makes explicit the fact that significant complementarity exists
 between improved seed varieties and the recommended inputs and practices.
 The treatment video is about twelve minutes long and can be found

\begin_layout Standard
The experiment was conducted in southeastern Uganda, an area known for its
 maize production where maize is considered both a food and a cash crop.
 As a matter of fact, much of the maize that is used as food aid in Sudan
 is sourced from here.
 Our sample consists of about 3500 smallholder maize farmers.
 As this study is part of a larger project that investigates maize seed
 supply chains, farmers were drawn from the catchment areas of agro-input
 shops.
 We started by listing all shops in eleven districts in southeastern Uganda,
 which roughly correspond to the Busoga kingdom, an exercise that let to
 about 350 agro-input dealers.
 We then asked these dealers about the villages where most of their customers
 come from.
 Enumerators were instructed to randomly sample ten households that grow
 maize in these locations.
 Consequently, about 3500 smallholders were sampled.
 Confining attention to farmers that were interviewed in all survey rounds,
 we remain with a balanced panel of 3,400 farmers.
 As such, farmers should have reasonable access to improved maize varieties.
 Baseline data was collected in April 2021, midline data in January and
 February 2022, and endline data in July and August 2022.

Adoption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We define smallholders' improved maize seed adoption as follows: We ask
 farmers on how many fields they cultivated maize in the preceding season.
 From these plots, we randomly select one field for which detailed questions
 about input use and cultivation practices are asked.
 A farmer is defined to be an adopter if he/she used not recycled hybrid
 seed or an OPV that was recycled less than four times.

 provides a visual representation of the evolution of improved seed adoption
 among farmers in our survey.
 We see that the share of adopters slowly increases over time: At baseline,
 we find that about 45 percent of farmers report to have adopted improved
 maize seed varies on the randomly selected plot.
 At midline, this figure has already increased to about 50 percent.
 At endline, the share of adopters is 54 percent of farmers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The figure also shows interesting dynamics.
 At the top, we see a substantial share of households (22 percent) that
 adopted according to all three survey rounds.
 These could be considered

 At the bottom of the chart, we find an equally substantial share (23 percent)
 that can similarly be categorized as

.
 However, we also see that a large group of farmers that adopts at baseline
 reverts to local farmer-saved seed at midline (16 percent) or still adopts
 at midline but eventually dis-adopts at endline (7 percent).
 Fortunately, large groups of households also enter into adoption.
 We see that 19 percent of non-adopting households are adopting at midline
 and twelve percent of households that are not adopting at both base- and
 midline become adopters at endline.
 Finally, there are also some households that seem to be moving in and out
 of adoption (8 percent) or moving out and back into adoption (9 percent).

Differences between treatment and control are estimated in a regression

 As this study was part of a larger study with also treatments at the agro-input

First we check if smallholder farmers are able to pick up the subtle messages
 in the treatment video.
 In a short quiz, enumerators read a set of alternative answers to farmers
 who then select the response that they feel is most appropriate.
 This quiz was only implemented at endline because we were wary of priming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We test if farmers know that when using improved maize seed like open-pollinated
 or hybrid seed: a) recommended cultivation practices like weeding or applying
 fertilizer are equally or even more important than when using lower quality
 seed, that they should b) weed and remove Striga as often c) apply the
 same amount or even more fertilizer, d) use equally good plots as they
 would if they would use lower quality seed, e) buy both improved seed and
 fertilizer when investing their money in agriculture, combine these different
 inputs instead of putting all their eggs in one basket.
 We also include one control question about the optimal seed rate and plant
 spacing, where we do not expect a difference between treatment and control
 because the correct answer featured in both videos.
 The six outcomes are also combined in an index following

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Caro: I shortened this part significantly.
 If you don't like it, here the old text:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We start with a general question, asking if farmers think recommended cultivatio
n practices like weeding and application of fertilizer is less, equally,
 or more important when using quality maize seed like OPV or hybrid seed.
 This is followed up by a more specific question, asking the farmer to indicate
 what applies for weeding when they are using hybrid seed.
 The options from which the farmer can choose are: 1) You do not need to
 weed and remove striga because hybrid seed varieties are treated to resist
 weed infestation; 2) You do not need to weed and remove striga in the first
 four weeks because hybrid seed is better at competing for sun, nutrients
 and water than normal seed; 3) You need to weed and remove striga just
 as you would with normal seed because maize seed does not compete well
 for sunlight, water and nutrients.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We have a similar question for fertilizer application when hybrid seed is
 used.
 The options here are that 1) You do not need to use inorganic fertilizer
 because you already bought seed.
 2) You can use less fertilizer than you normally would since improved maize
 seed grows faster 3) You need to use the amount of fertilizer that you
 would with normal seed because also improved seed varieties need nutrition;
 4) You should use more fertilizer than you would normally use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We then have a question that checks if farmers use sub-optimal plots by
 asking which plots are best suited to plant improved seed on.
 The options here are 1) that it is best to save improved seed for poor
 plots, as these need less nutrients; 2) that is best to use your improved
 seed for plots that are furthest away from the home, as improved seed need
 less care than normal seed; and 3) that the decision on what plot to plant
 improved seed should not be affected by the seed type that is used.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Another question tests if farmers think it is better to combine inputs,
 or to put all eggs in one basket.
 The question simply asks how to best invest money in agriculture.
 The options are that 1) It is best to invest all your money in seed, because
 poor seed quality is the main cause of low yields; 2) It is best to invest
 all your money in fertilizer, because poor soil is the main cause of low
 yields; and 3) It is best to buy both fertilizer and seed, because good
 seed without fertilizer does not give good results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Finally, we include a control question, where we do not expect a difference
 between treatment and control because the answer featured in both treatment
 and control videos.
 In particular, we ask about the optimal spacing and seed rate for maize.
 The options are 1) One foot between plants and two and a half foot between
 rows with one seed per hill; 2) One foot between plants and two and a half
 foot between rows with two seeds per hill; and 3) Two foot between plants
 and two and a half foot between rows with two seeds per hill.

The average treatment effects on knowledge can be found in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:knowledge"
plural "false"

\end_inset

.
 The first column (1) provides the mean in the control group, mainly to
 get an idea of effect sizes of the intervention.
 We see that knowledge is already high: 88 percent of farmers in the control
 group know that recommended cultivation practices like weeding or applying
 fertilizer are also important when using improved seed.
 The only outcome with significant scope for improvement appears to be the
 control question.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second column (2) shows the estimated difference between the treatment
 and control group for outcomes at endline, while the third column (3) also
 reports this difference, but only for the subset of farmers that adopted
 improved seed at baseline.
 We look at treatment heterogeneity at this level because it is likely that
 the treatment is not relevant for all smallholders: some farmers may not
 adopt because of other reasons than the ones we conjecture.
 For instance, improved seed may not be profitable in their specific case,
 or access to credit may be their primary constraint.
 This substantial share of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is excluded from the analysis if we only look at farmers who adopt at baseline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We see that knowledge, as measured by the quiz questions, has increased
 for all questions except for the control question.
 For instance, the share of farmers that knows complementary inputs and
 practices are at least as important when using improved seed increased
 from 87 to 89.2 percent.
 Furthermore, the share of farmers that recommends investing in different
 inputs (as opposed to investing all their money in only one input), increases
 from 74 to 76.2 percent.
 If we only consider farmers that adopted at baseline, the increase over
 the control amounts to almost five percentage points.
 However, after adjusting standard errors for clustering at the village
 level, none of the differences is statistically significant at conventional
 levels.
 This may be due to the fact that, ex-post, it turned out that many of the
 farmers were already able to indicate the correct response, and hence there
 is little scope for further improvement.
 At the same time, we note that all coefficient estimates are going in the
 same direction.
 Furthermore, even though farmers may possess the knowledge, there is still
 a difference between knowing and acting.
 We suspect that our intervention does not only increase knowledge, but
 also nudges farmer to practice what they know.
 Such aspirational effects are common in other studies that use videos featuring
 role models

Impact on adoption dynamics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now test the main hypothesis of this paper: if farmers that were made
 aware of the fact that improved seed also needs complementary inputs behave
 differently in terms of seed use in subsequent seasons.
 In particular, we look at the use of fresh improved seed varieties, i.e.
 hybrid seed which is not recycled and open-pollinated seed which is not
 recycled too often, our key adoption indicator that was also used in Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 to illustrate the dynamics of varietal adoption.
 In addition, we investigate other outcomes that are related or even partly
 overlapping.
 For instance, we look at the use of farmer-saved seed, as using farmer-saved
 seed is to some extent the opposite of technology adoption (but not completely
 because many farmer also recycle hybrid seed because they are not aware
 that it is not suited for recycling).
 We also test if there are differences in the use of recycled seed between
 the treatment and control group.
 A related outcome is the share of farmers that buy from agro-input dealers.
 The four outcomes are also combined in an index following

the note below the table says control group means - is it only the control

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 For instance, we see that 46 percent of farmers use fresh improved seed
 varieties and that one third of farmers report that the seed that they
 planted on the randomly selected plot was obtained from an agro-input dealer.
 As constructing the index involves standardization, its average is zero.
 The second column (2) illustrates balance and compares treatment and control
 outcomes at baseline.
 We see that the randomization was successful, as there is no significant
 difference in seed adoption behavior between farmers that will be exposed
 to the treatment and those that will not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third column (3) shows the difference between treatment and control
 for outcomes at midline, after households in the treatment group received
 treatment once.
 Our theory suggests that in response to being sensitized about the importance
 of using complementary inputs and cultivation practices when using improved
 seed varieties, a share of farmers will dis-adopt as their expected marginal
 return is reduced by the treatment (prediction 1).
 Dis-adoption implies that farmers will be less likely to plant fresh improved
 seed varieties and seed bought at agro-input shops, but more likely to
 use recycled and farmer-saved seed.
 We find that all coefficients go in the expected direction, however, we
 only find a significant difference for the share of farmers that planted
 recycled seed at midline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The comparisons in the third column hold for all farmers, while the fourth
 column (4) restricts the sample to farmers that adopted at baseline.
 We see that effects become stronger if we restrict attention to this subgroup
 (as expected, see prediction 1).
 Farmers that were exposed to the treatment are almost six percentage points
 less likely to adopt fresh improved seed varieties, and five percentage
 points more likely to revert to farmer-saved seed.
 We see a particularly strong increase in the share of farmers that uses
 seed recycled from the previous harvest in the treatment group and a somewhat
 lower but still significant reduction in farmers that bought seed from
 an agro-input dealer.
 For the subgroup of farmers that adopted at baseline, the treatment also
 has a significant and negative effect on the adoption index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fifth column (5) shows the difference between treatment and control
 for outcomes at endline, after treatment households were treated a second
 time, while the sixth column (6) repeats this analysis for farmers who
 reported adopting at baseline.
 At endline, differences seem to have disappeared, suggesting that the dis-adopt
ion effect is only temporary.
 This may be because farmers have moved to a new equilibrium where they
 know the true adoption premium and are more likely to become

Causal mechanisms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section,we investigate how the interventions affect the use of inputs
 and cultivation practices other than improved seed varieties, and expectations,
 as these are important variables in our theoretical model of Section

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Complementary inputs use and cultivation practices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effect of making farmers aware that improved seed needs the same complementa
ry inputs and effort than normal seed on the actual use of complementary
 inputs and practices is not clear a-priori.
 On the one hand, the intervention advocates for the use of complementary
 inputs and practices, and so one may expect that adopters increase use
 in the future as they adjust their practices to this new knowledge.
 However, we see that the first order response of the average farmer is
 to reduce the use of improved seed, which may offset the increased use
 of complementary inputs, at least in the short run.
 However, in subsequent seasons, when farmers adopt again, one would expect
 that at least some treatment farmers now also use more complementary inputs
 and put in more effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We look at a range of practices and inputs in line with what is featured
 in both treatment and control videos.
 A first outcome is an indicator for single-stand row-planting.
 Row planing is an important management practice that can lead to significant
 yield gains.
 Under row planting, space is used optimally and plants have sufficient
 nutrients and sunlight.
 However, row planting increases workload, hence farmers often engage in
 broadcasting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second outcome is the recommendation to reduce seed rate.
 Farmers often plant more seed than necessary because they fear that seed
 may not germinate.
 However, using more than two seeds per hill leads to stunted maize growth
 due to competition for light and nutrients.
 At the same time, just as for row-planting, a lower seed rate may increase
 the workload, as farmers may need to engage in gap filling after one week
 if seed fails to germinate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next three outcomes look at fertilizer use.
 Organic fertilizer application is important for soil structure, while DAP
 and Urea are used to provide maize essential nutrients at particular points
 in time.
 The cost of organic fertilizer is mainly in terms of labour, while both
 DAP and Urea needs to be bought from an agro-input shop and applied during
 planting (DAP) and at early stage of growth (Urea).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Weeding should be done within one week of planting and as often as possible.
 Official recommendations are to weed at least three times.
 Furthermore, invasive insects such as fall armyworm (
\emph on
Spodoptera frugiperda
\emph default
) or maize stalk borer (
\emph on
Busseola fusca
\emph default
) can severely reduce yields.
 Pesticides, including insecticides, are widely available in agro-input
 shops under commercial names such as Rocket,, Lalafos and Dudu acelamectin,
 and used buy many farmers.
 While weeding requires labour that can potentially be supplied by household
 members, pesticides comes at a pecuniary cost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we also look at differences in resowing or gap-filling.
 This involves revisiting the field after about one week and inspecting
 hills for seed germination.
 When a seed did not germinate, new seed is planted in that location.
 Gap-filling, seed rate and row planting are thus likely correlated.
 We also combine all outcomes into an overall index of practices following

 reports difference between treatment and control at midline;  fourth column
 (4) reports difference between treatment and control at midline for farmers
 that adopt at baseline; fifth column (5) reports difference between treatment

.
 As in previous tables, the first two columns ((1) and (2)), show control
 group means and orthogonality tests for outcomes before the treatment.
 Interestingly, we find some imbalance on the number of times that farmers
 report to have been weeding the randomly selected plot and the likelihood
 that farmers resow after one week.
 Note that the imbalance is in different directions, which makes it less
 likely that the imbalance is due to structural difference between treatment
 and control group such as lower effort in one group, but is likely to be
 the result of chance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At midline, column (3) shows that farmers do not use more inputs or put
 in more effort; on the contrary (and especially if we only consider a subset
 of farmers that adopted at baseline in column (4)) farmers appear to be
 less likely to engage in row planting and less likely to use DAP.
 However, according to the index, there is no overall effect of the intervention
 on input use and recommended cultivation practices at midline.
 After a second season (when the negative effect on improved seed use for
 treated farmers has disappears — see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Treatment-effects"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) we also do not find a consistent increase in input use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above results may indicate that farmers' response to the treatment is
 limited to decisions related to seed.
 However, it may also be that we lack power as a result to heterogeneous
 treatment effects.
 For instance, our theoretical model predicts a positive effect at endline
 only for farmers that adopt at baseline, dis-adopt at midline and are responsiv
e to the treatment (that is, they are not already aware of the importance
 of using improved seed, which is likely the case for always adopters).
 If we compare treatment and control farmers for the subset of farmers that
 adopts at baseline, does not adopt at midline, and adopt again at endline,
 we do indeed find that treated farmers use more fertilizer and pesticides
 and the index is significant at the ten percent level.
 However, such comparisons are likely to suffer from endogeneity bias, as
 the treatment affects adoption decisions at both mid- and endline.

\begin_layout Standard
To measure expectations, we simply asked farmers if they harvested as much
 maize from the plot as what they expected expected.
 We also measure production on the randomly selected plot.
 We look at total production, but also at productivity by dividing production
 of the plot by the size of the plot.

Results are reported in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 We again report control group means and baseline balance in the first two
 columns ((1) and (2)).
 At baseline, we did not ask if expectations were met on the randomly selected
 plot.
 Therefore we report the average in the control group at midline and we
 do not test for baseline balance.
 Note that a large majority of farmers indicated that they harvested less
 than expected.

Column (3) shows that in the treatment group, a significantly higher share
 of farmers than in the control group say that what they produced was also
 what they expected.
 This is even more so for the subset of farmers that adopted at baseline
 (column (4)).
 At endline, there is no difference between treatment and control anymore
 (columns (5) and (6)).
 This pattern suggests that a subset of farmers indeed started out with
 inflated expectations, and this was corrected after they learned that improved
 seed is not miracle seed.

Finally, the table shows that the average control group farmer cultivates
 about 470 kg on the random plot.
 The random plot seems to be on average slightly larger than one acre, such
 that productivity is about 440 kg per acre.
 The intervention does not seem to have any impact on production or productivity.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper was motivated by qualitative evidence that many farmers appear
 to overestimate the potential benefits of certain improved agricultural
 technologies.
 The cost of a particular modern commercial input that a farmer wants to
 start using, such as improved seed varieties or inorganic fertilizers,
 is often substantial and competes with other (complementary) agricultural
 inputs.
 Furthermore, modern inputs are generally marketed with a focus on a few
 dimensions (eg seed that is treated against certain types of weed), and
 so farmers may reduce inputs (like herbicides) and efforts (like manual
 weeding) related to this dimension.
 However, to get the most out of improved technologies, it is important
 to also use complementary inputs and proper agronomic practices, otherwise
 outcomes may be lower than expected.
 If farmers incorrectly attribute disappointing outcomes to the technology
 itself rather than improper use, this could lead to a pattern where farmers
 who try out a new technology switch back to local seed in the next season.
 In a sample of maize smallholder farmers in Uganda, we indeed see substantial
 dis-adoption over time.
 Furthermore, a large majority of farmers indicate that they expected higher
 yields from their plots.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To credibly test the hypothesis that farmers think of improved seed varieties
 are

\end_inset

, we set up a field experiment around an engaging video on recommended cultivati
on practices for maize growing that was shown to farmers before the planting
 season at the time when farmer select the seed that they will use.
 Two versions of the video were produced: one control video and one treatment
 video.
 The treatment video was essentially the same video as the control video,
 expect that in the treatment video, after each practice or input that was
 shown, it was explicitly mentioned that this is

also important when you are using improved seed varieties such as hybrid
 seed or OPVs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 We then randomly allocated treatment and control status to villages, where
 a set of farmers were then shown the corresponding video.
 We revisited farmers in treatment and control villages a first time after
 one agricultural season and a second time after a second season to test
 if there were differences in farmer knowledge, seed use, complementary
 input use and agronomic practices, and expectations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first tested if farmers picked up the subtle messages that lie at the
 heart of our light-touch information treatment.
 To do so, we subjected farmers to a multiple choice quiz.
 While we did not find average treatment effects that differed significantly
 from zero, we did see that all coefficients were going in the expected
 direction.
 We suspect that the lack of statistical significance may be due to the
 already high knowledge at baseline.
 However, even when most farmers already possess the knowledge, the treatment
 may still have made this knowledge more salient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Turning to the main outcome—behavior related to seed use—we found that in
 the season immediately following the treatment, treated farmers were less
 likely to use improved seed obtained from agro-input dealers and revert
 back to farmer-saved seed.
 In line with our expectations, this switching back to farmer-saved seed
 was only short lived: in the next season, there was no difference between
 treatment and control groups anymore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To see if the main impact pathway runs through the budget constraint, we
 looked at complementary input use.
 We found little evidence that the intervention increased input use or the
 use of recommended practices.
 If anything, we actually see that at midline, the use of inputs in the
 treatment group is lower than in the control.
 However, if we restrict the sample to farmers that dis-adopt at midline
 and adopt again at endline, we do see an increase in input use at endline.
 Another intermediate outcome is related to expectations.
 We found that farmers that received the treatment were more likely to report
 at midline that what they harvested was in line with what they expected.

Our results differ from various other studies that found that improved technolog
y increased agricultural productivity by crowding in modern inputs and cultivati
on practices

 The reason for these opposite effects may be due to the fact that 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 provided the improved technology (also seed) for free as part of there
 experiment, potentially resulting in an income effect in the sense that
 money that was not used to buy seed was used to buy complementary inputs.

\end_inset

 do discuss the possibility that their effects are driven by an income effect.
 However, under income effect, they understand the effect of the additional
 income resulting from the adoption of the technology (a flood tolerant
 seed variety).
 The income effect we are concerned about is the one that is due to the
 fact that farmers receive seed for free, potentially freeing up money for
 other investments.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In our experiment, no free seed was provided, so when the adoption decision
 was made, farmers had to take the additional cost of seed and the fact
 that expensive complementary inputs would need to be purchased into account,
 leading to disadoption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our study further casts doubt on the suggestion that bayesian learning via
 sequential adoption can be a successful strategy for smallholder farmers
 in the long run 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "10.2307/1242825,https://doi.org/10.1111/agec.12124"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 If important interaction effects between different inputs are present,
 it is unlikely that farmers can try out all possible combinations of inputs
 to learn about these interactions in a bayesian fashion.
 Furthermore, if farmers can not learn about the interactions, expectations
 may be incorrect, leading to sub-optimal adoption patterns, further complicatin
g learning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our study also has important implications for both policy markers and the
 private sector.
 When designing agricultural extension and advisory services, policy makers
 should highlight the complementarity of modern inputs.
 If not, their efforts risk to be short lived.
 Worse, false perceptions of poor quality may crowd out the market for quality
 inputs 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "10.1093/qje/qjx009"

\end_inset

.
 Policy makers often subsidize improved technologies to scale up adoption
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "JAYNE20181"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 While this may work for some stand-alone technologies

before "eg."
key "https://doi.org/10.1093/ajae/aay108"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, promoting technologies that require complementary inputs (such as the
 use of subsidized or even free seed trial packs) may be counterproductive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is also a role for industry.
 As part of their marketing strategy, seed producers and agro-input dealers
 tend to highlight particular traits of the technology they use, such as
 high yields.
 Furthermore, they may not be tempted to actively promote the use of complementa
ry inputs if they are produced by companies that target the same customers
 as they do.
 In both cases, short term benefits may lead to long run losses.
