Miracle Seed: Biased Expectations, Complementary Input Use, and the Dynamics
 of Smallholder Technology Adoption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Farmers that try out agricultural technologies, such as improved seed varieties
 obtained from agro-input dealers, may hold unrealistic expectations about
 these technologies.
 The fact that they paid a significant price for certain traits of the technolog
y, such as higher yield or pest resistance, may lead them to invest less
 in complementary inputs such as fertilizers or pesticides and reduce management
 practices such as weeding.
 Subsequent disappointment about the performance of the technology may then
 be erroneously attributed to the technology itself, resulting in dis-adoption.
 We provide a simple model of technology adoption, derive a cluster of predictio
ns and test these predictions using a field experiment among 3,500 smallholder
 maize farmers in Uganda.
 In the experiment, a treatment group gets explicit information on the importanc
e of combining improved technologies and recommended farming practices.
 We find some evidence that in the short run, our message scares farmers
 away from commercial seed, back to local land-races.
 There is further suggestive evidence that least some farmers adjust expectation
s and move back into adoption in the next season.
 We conclude that policy makers and industry should focus on technology
 adoption as a package of complementary inputs and efforts, instead of marketing
 a single technology.

To feed a growing population in a sustainable way, farmers throughout the

 To achieve this objective, much is expected from new technologies, especially
 from higher yielding cultivars

 At the same time, agricultural production will become more challenging
 due to the climate crisis.
 Also in this context, seed varieties that are selected to be more resilient
 against droughts and diseases are thought to be at least part of the solution

Unfortunately, the adoption of such technologies is lagging in areas where
 it has the largest potential.

 progress has stagnated on the continent

\end_inset

.
 Significant heterogeneity underlies this general stagnation.
 For instance, at the micro level, we often observe dis-adoption, where
 farmers choose to switch back to technologies they have been using for
 decades after trying out a new technology once or twice

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many reasons why farmers do not move into a state of consistent
 adoption.
 An obvious one is that the inputs that some farmers previously used simply
 become unavailable

 Farmers may also learn over time that a particular technology is not suitable
 for them or does not meet their expectations

 Heterogeneity in the quality of the input, coupled with the fact that it
 is often hard to judge the quality of the input even ex-ante, may also
 result in dis-adoption

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we consider the possibility that farmers hold inflated expectatio
ns of inputs as an explanation for their dis-adoption.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Over the years, we uncovered many anecdotes in a variety of contexts that
 point to this explanation.
 For instance, many farmers use (inorganic) fertilizer once and assume this
 will lead to lasting improvements in soil fertility.
 However, these fertilizers need to be applied in each cropping cycle to
 be effective.
 In the context of seed, extension officers often complain that farmers
 consider the trial seed packs they provide as some kind of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

miracle seed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which they can just broadcast on their least fertile plots without further
 management and still get exceptional harvests.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 These inflated expectations have their origin in the fact that monetary
 outlays are necessary for improved technologies, and farmers may consider
 this as a signal that modern inputs are substitutes for other investments
 they would typically make.
 In reality, however, for improved technologies to reach their full potential,
 equal or even additional complementary investments are necessary.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "https://doi.org/10.1111/agec.12721"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 show that farming with hybrid seed is far more costly than farming with
 traditional seeds.
 The extra production costs include the cost of seeds, but also fertilizer
 costs as hybrid farming requires more chemical fertilizers to achieve significa
nt yield improvements, and (hired) labor and land preparation costs as hybrid
 farming again requires more specific and complex cultivation techniques.
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This could be two impact pathways really: inflated expectations and reduced
 effort.
 Can one have inflated expectations and still provide same effort? Can one
 have correct expectations but reduce effort?
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inflated expectations about the performance of improved technologies can
 have lasting impacts on adoption if farmers attribute poor outcomes to
 the technology, instead of the reduced use of complementary inputs.
 This learning failure is understandable: as many factors simultaneously
 affect yields, learning about the causal impact of a new technology from
 a single experience is difficult, and cognitive constrained farmers may
 pay attention to the wrong attributes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "10.1093/qje/qju015"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we present a simple model of technology adoption that incorporate
s the ideas above.
 In this model, budget constrained farmers compare expected returns of an
 improved technology to business-as-usual.
 The new technology comes at a cost, while the traditional technology does
 not.
 Both technologies, though, require complementary inputs and efforts that
 directly affect productivity, yet for farmers that experiment with the
 new technology, this technology is considered to be a substitute for some
 of the other inputs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We test the predictions of the model using a field experiment among 3500
 maize farmers in eastern Uganda.
 At the heart of the field experiment is a light-touch information intervention
 that attempts to correct the perception that the improved technology is
 a substitute for other inputs and efforts.
 In particular, we show all farmers in our sample a short engaging video
 about the use of improved agro-inputs and recommended management practices
 for maize growing.
 In the treatment group we essentially show the same video, except that
 in certain parts—for instance when the use of inorganic fertilizers is
 demonstrated or when weeding is explained—we highlight that it remains
 important to use additional inputs and to perform management practices
 when using improved seed varieties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start with testing if farmers are able to extract the relevant information
 from the treatment video by testing knowledge after two full seasons post
 intervention.
 We find some indications that in the treatment group more farmers are aware
 of the importance of combining inputs than in the control group.
 Turning to adoption behavior, we see that farmers in the treatment group
 are more likely to use seed saved from the previous season.
 If we confine attention to only farmers that adopted at baseline, we see
 that farmers that were exposed to the treatment video were also less likely
 to obtain seed from agro-input dealers, more likely to use landraces, and
 less likely to use improved seed varieties such as hybrids or Open Pollinated
 Varieties (OPV).
 However, in the subsequent season, these differences between treatment
 and control groups have disappeared.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then look at some secondary outcomes to explore the mechanisms at work
 behind the intervention.
 First, we test if the intervention has an effect on the use of complementary
 inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides, as well as on cultivation practices
 such as row planting and weeding.
 We would have expected a positive impact here, at least in the longer run
 when farmers were given sufficient time to realign their production with
 the new knowledge, but statistical power may be an issue here.
 Second, without adjustments in complementary input use and practices, the
 intervention may still have lasting impacts if farmers' expectations become
 more realistic, as we do see that a larger share of farmers in the treatment
 group reports that yields are what they expected than in the control group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our work has important implications for both public and private sector stakehold
ers.
 The main conclusion is that a more holistic systems approach is necessary
 when encouraging varietal turnover and adoption of improved seed varieties
 by smallholder farmers.
 Governments should provide (free or subsidized) innovation packages that
 include complementary inputs as well, instead of focusing on a single technolog
y such as seed trial packs.
 Agricultural advisory services should manage expectations of farmers with
 respect to modern agricultural inputs.
 Agro-input dealers should be careful when marketing individual products
 for a particular trait.

Studies about technology adoption often (implicitly) assume some kind of
 graduation model, where farmers switch to a high level equilibrium of sustained
 adoption once initial conditions, in terms of for instance access to informatio

 Especially in applied micro-economic field experiments, researchers focus
 on a limited number of agricultural seasons, and are unable to fully appreciate
 the dynamics of technology adoption.
 However, a number of studies document significant levels of dis-adoption

 is a learning failure that leads to dis-adoption.
 Indeed, heterogeneity in farmer characteristics implies that farmers need
 to learn if a technology is suitable for their specific case 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Generally, farmers learn through a combination of own experiences and observing
 others 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "foster1995learning"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, learning about a new technology is hard.
 Based on observable characteristics, it is often difficult to determine
 what the quality of an input is before using it.
 Some even argue that many technologies are credence goods 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2018.1464143"

 because their evaluation is also hard ex-post, as many factors, including
 some that are out of the control of the farmer such as weather conditions
 and pests, affect outcomes

\begin_layout Standard
One strand of the literature argues that sequential adoption leads to experienti
al learning by farmers.
 In cases where technologies are bundled in packages, it is often observed
 that farmers sequentially adopt components of the package, rather than
 the entire package

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 argue that this is due to farmers employing a Bayesian approach to learning,
 where they try to isolate the impact of one component of the package.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, there are circumstances under which this strategy is not optimal
 because it does not allow farmers to identify potential interaction effects
 between the inputs.
 Indeed, the reason why interventions are presented as a package often means
 that these interaction effects are not trivial.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 find that banana tissue culture, a technology to ensure that banana plantlets
 are free from pests and diseases, leads to a 7 percent yield gain in Kenya.
 However, they also find that improving access to irrigation could lift
 yield gains above 20 percent.
 It seems unlikely that farmers follow a sequential learning path that allows
 for all possible interactions between the different technologies.
 Furthermore, behavioral constrains may prevent farmers from effective learning.
 It is for instance possible that farmers pay attention to the wrong attributes

Finally, our treatment comes in the form of a short and engaging video.
 There is a large literature that shows that videos can be important vehicles

 in the present study were performing significantly better on a knowledge
 test, were more likely to apply recommended practices and fertilizer than
 households that did not view the video.
 These same households also reported maize yields 10.5 percent higher than
 the ones of the control group.
 Our study also contributes to this literature as it tests if a video is
 effective in transmitting subtle information.

 Yield for landraces is a function of inputs used:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Y_{it}^{L}=Y_{it}\left(X_{it}^{L}\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and this relationship is assumed to be positive with increasing returns
 to scale.
 We assume 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dY_{it}}{dX_{it}^{L}}>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{d^{2}Y_{it}}{dX_{it}^{L2}}>0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yield for hybrids follows a similar function as yield for landraces, but
 adds a positive and constant hybrid premium 
\begin_inset Formula $(A>0)$
\end_inset

.
 However, the premium is only realized when 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{it}^{H}\geq X_{it}^{L}$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Y_{it}^{H}=A\left(X_{it}^{H}\geq X_{it}^{L}\right)+Y_{it}\left(X_{it}^{L}\right)\label{eq:truerel}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

However, there may be reasons why farmers reduce input use when adopting
 hybrid seed.
 For instance, if they face a budget constrained, then inputs will be reduced
 by the cost of seed, resulting in lower yields:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Y_{it}^{H}=Y_{it}\left(X_{it}^{L}-\frac{b_{t}s_{it}}{w_{t}}\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

If farmers would be able to, at least on average, predict the future, such
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(Y_{it+1}\right)=Y_{it+1}+\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon\sim N(0,\sigma)$
\end_inset

, their decision to adopt would depend on the difference in yield between
 hybrid and landrace seed, on the relative prices of the inputs, and on
 the yield responses of the inputs.
 We introduce farmer heterogeneity into the model by assuming that at least
 some farmers are not aware of the true relationship between 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{it}^{H}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{it}$
\end_inset

, but instead believe that 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(Y_{it+1}^{H}\right)=A+Y_{it}\left(X_{it}^{L}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The credit constrained farmer's expected yield will then be:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E\left(Y_{it+1}^{H}\right)=A+Y_{it}\left(X_{it}^{L}-\frac{b_{t}s_{it}}{w_{t}}\right)\label{eq:miracle}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and as a result, the farmer will use too much hybrid seed and not enough
 other inputs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:three"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is restricted to decision making in one agricultural season.
 However, farmers need to decide each season, and will use information gained
 from past experiences to form expectations.
 Farmers who are not aware of the true relationship between 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{it}^{H}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{it}$
\end_inset

 and over-adopt as described above will be disappointed once outcomes are
 revealed.
 Due to the many factors at play in agricultural production, they may be
 unable to learn about the complex relationship between 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{it}^{H}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{it}$
\end_inset

 from their limited experiential data.
 Instead, these farmers may simply reduce their expectations of the hybrid
 markup, in the limit setting 
\begin_inset Formula $E(A)=0$
\end_inset

, leading them to dis-adopt in the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model leads to different farmer types based on their dynamic profile
 and knowledge.
 First, there is a group of farmers that is knowledgeable about the true
 relationship between 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{it}^{H}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{it}$
\end_inset

in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:truerel"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, and as a result has expectations that match production outcomes.
 For a share of these farmers, the marginal cost of adoption is lower than
 the expected marginal return in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:three"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, and as a result they always adopt, while for another subset of these farmers,
 the marginal cost of adoption is higher than the expected marginal return,
 so they will never adopt (unless the technologies, the prices of technologies
 or other circumstances change).
 Providing information about the complementarity between improved seed and
 other inputs will have no effect on these farmers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another group of farmers is not knowledgeable about the interaction effect,
 but instead believes that there is always a hybrid premium (equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

noprefix "false"

).
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Caro: I believe this group of farmers could over- or underestimate the hybrid
 premium, not only overestimate.
 Farmers initially overestimating the hybrid premium will never start adopting
 based on our information, will they? Only the ones overestimating the premium,
 then due to a bad experience (or a story told by a neighbor) underestimate
 the premium will adopt due to our information, right? (see paragraph after
 equation 7)
\end_layout

\end_inset

 A subset of these farmers does not adopt because their marginal cost of
 adoption exceeds the expected marginal returns.
 Providing these farmers with information may lead them to reconsider.
 Another subset of these farmers without knowledge about the true relationship
 between 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{it}^{H}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{it}$
\end_inset

 does adopt because their marginal cost of adoption is lower than their
 expected marginal returns.
 Providing these farmers with information may lead them to dis-adopt in
 the short run conditional on this new information.

While both subgroups are likely respond to the provision of new information,
 in this paper we are mainly concerned with farmers that adopt at baseline

\begin_layout Standard
Based on extensive interviews with experts, we developed a script for the
 video.
 It starts with showing a couple (man and woman) in a healthy maize field
 inspecting their crops.
 The man narrates that they have been farmers for more than ten years but
 that their fields have not always been this productive.
 He recounts how they used to struggle to feed their children, but that
 over time, they learned how to grow more maize.
 The secret of their success, they continue, lies in the adoption of improved
 technologies and best practices, such as the use of improved seed, organic
 and inorganic fertilizer, and optimal seed rates and plant spacing.
 They conclude this introduction by stating that they are proud to be successful
 farmers that can feed their families and even have some surplus to sell
 on the market.
 The viewer is then invited to become a successful farmer as well by paying
 close attention as the role model farmers explain in detail the most important
 inputs and practices that changed their lives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After this introduction, a poorly managed maize field is shown.
 Maize growth is stunted because of Striga, a parasitic weed that feeds
 on the roots of maize plants.
 It is explained that this was how their garden looked in the past, when
 they thought weeding was a waste of time, improved seed was too expensive,
 and soil does not need fertilizer.
 But after a particularly bad season, they suffered and decided things needed
 to change.
 It is then shown how crop residues and animal dung is used to make organic
 manure, and how this is applied to the field.
 It is advised to start field preparations early, as timely planting (immediatel
y after the first rains) is very important to get good yields.
 The focus then shifts to row planting, where the recommended spacing of
 one foot between plants and 2.5 feet between rows is shown.
 The role model farmers also mention the expected increase in yield from
 row planting.
 At this stage, it is also recommended to add inorganic fertilizer (Di-Ammonium
 Phosphate).
 It is then shown that one seed of a common hybrid seed is place in each
 hill.

The video then proceeds by recommending resowing of hills where seed did
 not germinate after ten to 12 days to keep optimal plant density.
 The actor in the video notes that weeding is especially important in the
 first 40 days as maize does not compete well for light and nutrients.
 It is recommended to start a first round of weeding 18 to 20 days after
 planting.
 It is also mentioned that at this stage, removal of Striga is very important
 as the weed has reached the roots of the maize plant yet and damage can
 still be avoided.
 A second round of weeding is recommended 2 to 3 weeks later.
 Four weeks after planting, when maize is knee high, it is demonstrated
 how another type of inorganic fertilizer (Urea) is applied as top dressing.
 Around the tasseling stage, a final round of weeding is recommended.

\begin_layout Standard
The experiment was conducted in southeastern Uganda, an area known for its
 maize production where maize is considered both a food and a cash crop.
 As a matter of fact, much of the maize that is used as food aid in Sudan
 is sourced from here.
 Our sample consists of about 3500 smallholder maize farmers.
 As this study is part of a larger project that investigates maize seed
 supply chains, farmers were drawn from the catchment areas of agro-input
 shops.
 We started by listing all shops in 11 districts in southeastern Uganda,
 which roughly correspond to the Busoga kingdom, an exercise that let to
 about 350 agro-input dealers.
 We then asked these dealers about the villages where most of their customers
 come from.
 Enumerators were instructed to randomly sample ten households that grow
 maize in these locations.
 Consequently, about 3500 smallholders were sampled.
 Confining attention to farmers that were interviewed in all survey rounds,
 we remain with a balanced panel of 3,400 farmers.
 As such, farmers should have reasonable access to improved maize varieties.
 Baseline data was collected in April 2021, midline data in January and
 February 2022, and endline data in July and August 2022.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Adoption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We define smallholders' improved maize seed adoption as follows: We ask
 farmers on how many fields they cultivated maize in the preceding season.
 From these plots, we randomly select one field for which detailed questions
 about input use and cultivation practices are asked.
 A farmer is defined to be an adopter if he/she used not recycled hybrid
 seed or an OPV that was recycled less than four times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 provides us with a visual representation of improved maize seed adoption
 among farmers in our sample.
 We see that the share of adopters slowly increases over time.
 At baseline, we find that about 45 percent of farmers report to have adopted
 improved seed on the randomly selected plot.
 At midline, this figure has increased to about 50 percent.
 At endline, 54 percent of farmers adopt improved varieties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The figure also shows interesting dynamics.
 At the top, we see a substantial share of households (22 percent) that
 adopted according to all three survey rounds.
 These could be considered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

always adopters
\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
 At the bottom of the chart, we find an equally substantial share (23 percent)
 that can similarly be categorized as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

never adopters
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 However, we also see that a large group of farmers that adopts at baseline
 reverts to local landraces at midline (16 percent) or still adopts at midline
 but eventually dis-adopts at endline (7 percent).
 Fortunately, large groups of households also enter into adoption.
 We see that 19 percent of non-adopting households are adopting at midline
 and 12 percent of households that are not adopting at both base- and midline
 become adopters at endline.
 Finally, there are also some households that seem to be moving in and out
 of adoption (8 percent) or moving out and back into adoption (9 percent).

Impact on knowledge

First we check if smallholder farmers are able to pick up the subtle messages
 in the treatment video.
 In a short quiz, enumerators read a set of alternative answers to farmers
 who then select the response that they feel is most appropriate.
 This quiz was only implemented at endline because we were wary of priming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We test if farmers know that when using improved maize seed like open-pollinated
 or hybrid seed: a) recommended cultivation practices like weeding or applying
 fertilizer are equally or even more important than when using lower quality
 seed, that they should b) weed and remove Striga as often c) apply the
 same amount or even more fertilizer, d) use equally good plots as they
 would if they would use lower quality seed, e) buy both improved seed and
 fertilizer when investing their money in agriculture, combine these different
 inputs instead of putting all their eggs in one basket.
 We also include one control question about the optimal seed rate and plant
 spacing, where we do not expect a difference between treatment and control
 because the correct answer featured in both videos.

Caro: I shortened this part significantly.
 If you don't like it, here the old text:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We start with a general question, asking if farmers think recommended cultivatio
n practices like weeding and application of fertilizer is less, equally,
 or more important when using quality maize seed like OPV or hybrid seed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is followed up by a more specific question, asking the farmer to indicate
 what applies for weeding when they are using hybrid seed.
 The options from wihc the farmer can choose are: 1) You do not need to
 weed and remove striga because all hybrid seed varieties are treated to
 resist weed infestation; 2) You do not need to weed and remove striga in
 the first four weeks because hybrid seed is better at competing for sun,
 nutrients and water than normal seed; 3) You need to weed and remove striga
 just as you would with normal seed because maize seed does not compete
 well for sunlight, water and nutrients.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We have a similar question for fertilizer application when hybrid seeds
 are used.
 The options here are that 1) You do not need to use inorganic fertilizer
 because you already bought seed.
 2) You can use less fertilizer than you normally would since improved maize
 seed grows faster 3) You need to use the amount of fertilizer that you
 would with normal seed because also improved seed varieties need nutrition;
 4) You should use more fertilizer than you would normally use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We then have a question that checks if farmers use sub-optimal plots by
 asking which plots are best suited to plant improved seed on.
 The options here are 1) that it is best to save improved seed for poor
 plots, as these need less nutrients; 2) that is best to use your improved
 seed for plots that are furthest away from the home, as improved seed need
 less care than normal seed; and 3) that the decision on what plot to plant
 improved seed should not be affected by the seed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Another question tests if farmers think it is better to combine or put all
 eggs in one basket.
 The question simply asks how to best invest money in agriculture.
 The options are that 1) It is best to invest all your money in seed, because
 poor seed quality is the main cause of low yields; 2) It is best to invest
 all your money in fertilizer, because poor soil is the main cause of low
 yields; and 3) It is best to buy both fertilizer and seed, because good
 seed without fertilizer does not give good results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Finally, we include a control questions, where we do not expect a difference
 between treatment and control because the answer featured in both treatment
 and control videos.
 In particular, we ask about the optimal spacing and seed rate for maize.
 The options are 1) One foot between plants and 2 and ½ foot between rows
 with one seed per hill; 2) One foot between plants and 2 and ½ foot between
 rows with two seeds per hill; and 3) Two foot between plants and 2 and
 ½ foot between rows with two seeds per hill.

 The first column (1) provides the mean in the control group, mainly to
 get an idea of effect sizes of the intervention.
 We see that knowledge is already high: 88 percent of farmers in the control
 group know that recommended cultivation practices like weeding or applying
 fertilizer are also important when using improved seed.
 The only outcome with significant scope for improvement appears to be the
 control question.

The second column (2) shows the estimated difference between the treatment
 and control group for outcomes at endline, while the third column (3) also
 reports this difference, but only for the subset of farmers that adopted
 improved seed at baseline.
 We look at treatment heterogeneity at this level because it is likely that
 the treatment is not relevant for all smallholders: some farmers may not
 adopt because of other reasons than the ones we conjecture.
 For instance, improved seed may not be profitable in their specific case,
 or access to credit may be their primary constraint.
 This substantial share of

 is excluded from the analysis if we only look at farmers who adopt at baseline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We see that knowledge, as measured by the quiz questions, has increased
 for all questions except for the control question.
 For instance, the share of farmers that knows complementary inputs and
 practices are at least as important when using improved seed increased
 from 88 to 90.2 percent.
 Furthermore, the share of farmers that recommends investing in different
 inputs (as opposed to investing all their money in only one input), increases
 from 75 to to 77.2 percent.
 If we only consider farmers that adopted at baseline, the increase over
 the control amounts to almost 5 percentage points.
 However, after adjusting standard errors for clustering at the village
 level, none of the differences is statistically significant at conventional
 levels.
 This may be due to the fact that many of the farmers are able to indicate
 the correct response, and hence there is little scope for improvement.
 At the same time, we note that all coefficient estimates go in the expected
 direction.
 Furthermore, even though farmers may possess the knowledge, there is a
 difference between knowing and putting this knowledge into practice.
 We suspect that our intervention does not only increase knowledge but also
 nudges farmer to practice what they know.

Impact of treatment on adoption dynamics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start by testing the main hypothesis of this paper—that farmers that
 were made aware of the fact that improved seed also need complementary
 inputs—behave differently in terms of seed use in the subsequent season.
 In particular, we look at use of fresh improved seed varieties (our key
 adoption indicator that was also used in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 to illustrate the dynamics of technology adoption).
 However, we also look at other outcomes that are often partly overlapping
 or related.
 For instance, we also look at the use of landraces, which is in a sense
 the reverse of technology adoption.
 We also test whether there are differences in the use of recycled seed
 between the treatment and control group.
 Also here we consider the opposite: the share of farmers that buy from
 agro-input dealers.
 The four outcomes are also combined in an index following

.
 The first column of the table shows sample means at baseline for the five
 outcomes (and standard deviations in brackets below).
 For instance, we see that 46 percent of farmers use improved seed varieties
 and that one third of farmers report that the seed that they planted on
 the randomly selected plot was obtained from an agro-input dealer.

 The second column serves as the typical orthogonality test and compares
 treatment and control outcomes at baseline.
 We see that the randomization was successful, as there is no difference
 between outcomes of farmers that will be exposed to the treatment and those
 that will not in seed adoption behavior.
 The third column shows the difference between treatment and control at
 midline, after households received treatment.
 Our theory suggests that in response to being sensitized about the importance
 of using complementary inputs and cultivation practices, less farmers would
 use improved seed varieties from agro-input dealers, and revert to farmer
 saved landraces.
 We find that the coefficients go in the right direction, however, we only
 find a significant difference for the share of farmers that planted recycled
 seed at midline.

 farmers for outcome measured at baseline; third column (3) reports difference

 reports difference between treatment and control for outcomes at midline
 for farmers that adopt at baseline; fifth column (5) reports difference

\begin_layout Standard
The differences in the fourth column are for all farmers, while the fifth
 column restricts the sample to only farmers that adopted at baseline.
 We do indeed see effects become stronger if we restrict attention to this
 subgroup.
 We now see that farmers that were exposed to the treatment are almost 6
 percentage points less likely to adopt improved seed, and 5 percentage
 points more likely to adopt landraces.
 We see a particularly strong increase in the share of farmers that use
 seed recycled from the previous harvest in the treatment group and a somewhat
 lower but still significant reduction in farmer that bought seed from an
 agro-input dealer.
 For the subgroup of farmers that adopted in at baseline, the adoption index
 is now also significantly negative for the treated farmers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fifth column shows the difference between treatment and control at endline,
 after households received treatment a second time, while the sixth column
 repeats this analysis but only for farmers who report adopting at baseline.
 At endline, differences between treatment and control seemed to have disappeare
d, suggesting that the dis-adoption effect is only temporary.
 This may because farmers have moved to a new equilibrium where they are
 now more likely to become always adopters.

\begin_layout Subsection
Causal mechanisms

\begin_layout Subsubsection
complementary inputs use and cultivation practices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effect of making farmers aware that improved seed needs the same complementa
ry inputs and effort than normal seed on the actual use of complementary
 inputs and practices is not clear a-priori.
 On the one hand, the intervention advocates for the use of complementary
 inputs and practices, and so one may expect that adopters increase use
 in the future as they adjust their practices to this new knowledge.
 However, we see that the first order response of the average farmer is
 to reduce the use of improved seed, which may offset the increased use
 of complementary inputs, at least in the short run.
 However, in subsequent seasons, when farmers adopt again, one would expect
 that at least some treatment farmers now also use more complementary inputs
 and put in more effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We look at a range of practices and inputs in line with what is features
 in both treatment and control video.
 A first outcome is an indicator for single-stand row-planting.
 Row planing is an important management practice that can lead to significant
 yield gains.
 Under row planting, space is used optimally and plants have sufficient
 nutrients and sunlight.
 However, row planting increases workload, hence farmers often engage in
 broadcasting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second outcome is the recommendation to reduce seed rate.
 Farmers often plant more seed than necessary because they fear that seed
 may not germinate.
 However, using more than 2 seeds per hill leads to stunted maize growth
 due to competition for light and nutrients.
 At the same time, just as for row-planting, a lower seed rate may increase
 the workload, as farmers may need to engage in gap filling after one week
 if seed fails to germinate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next three outcomes look at fertilizer use.
 Organic fertilizer application is important for soil structure, while DAP
 and Urea are used to provide maize essential nutrients at particular points
 in time.
 The cost of organic fertilizer is mainly in terms of labour, while both
 DAP and Urea needs to be bought from an agro-input shop and applied during
 planting (DAP) and at early stage of growth (Urea).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Weeding should be done within one week of planting and as often as possible.
 Official recommendations are to weed at least three times.
 Furthermore, invasive insects such as fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda)
 or maize stalk borer (Busseola fusca) can severely reduce yields.
 Pesticides, including insecticides, are widely available in agro-input
 shops under commercial names such as Rocket,, Lalafos and Dudu acelamectin,
 and used buy many farmers.
 Again, while weeding requires labour that can potentially be supplied by
 household members, pesticides comes at a pecuniary cost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we also look at differences in resowing or gap-filling.
 This involves revisiting the field after about one week and inspecting
 hills for seed germination.
 When a seed did not germinate, new seeds are planted in that location.
 Gap-filling, seed rate and row planting are thus likely correlated.
 We also combine all outcomes into an overall index of practices.

Note: First column (1) reports control group means (and standard deviations

 farmers for outcome measured at baseline; third column (3) reports difference
 between treatment and control for outcomes at midline;  fourth column (4)
 reports difference between treatment and control for outcomes at midline
 for farmers that adopt at baseline; fifth column (5) reports difference
 between treatment and control for outcomes at endline;  sixth column (6)
 reports difference between treatment and control for outcomes at endline
 for farmers that adopt at baseline; **, * and + denote significance at

Results are in Table

\end_inset

.
 As in previous tables, the first two columns show control group means and
 orthogonality tests for outcomes before the treatment.
 Interestingly, we find some imbalance on the number of times that farmers
 report to have been weeding the randomly selected plot and the likelihood
 that farmers resow after one week.
 Note that the imbalance is in different directions, which makes it less
 likely that the imbalance is due to structural difference between treatment
 and control group, but should be attributed to chance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At midline, column (3) shows that farmers do not use more inputs or put
 in more effort; on the contrary (and especially if we only consider a subset
 of farmers that adopted at baseline in column (4)) farmers appear to be
 less likely to engage in row planting and less likely to use DAP.
 However, according to the index, there is no overall effect of the intervention
 on input use and recommended cultivation practices at midline.
 After a second season (when the negative effect on improved seed use for
 treated farmers has disappears — see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Treatment-effects"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) we also do not find that a consistent increase in input use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above results may indicate that farmers' response to the treatment is
 limited to decisions related to seed.
 However, it may also be that we lack power as a result to heterogeneous
 treatment effects.
 For instance, our theoretical model predicts a positive effect at endline
 only for farmers that adopt at baseline, dis-adopt at midline and are responsiv
e to the treatment (that is, they are not already aware of the importance
 of using improved seed, which is likely the case for always adopters).
 If compare treatment and control farmers for the subset of farmers that
 adopts at baseline, does not adopt at midline, and adopts again at endline,
 we do indeed find that treated farmers use more fertilizer and pesticides
 and the index is significant at the 10 percent level.
 However, such comparisons are likely to suffer from endogeneity bias, as
 the treatment affects adoption decisions are both mid- and endline.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
expectations and outcomes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another key mechanism in the model is related to expectations.
 In this section, we see if the treatment had an impact on farmers expectations.
 Furthermore, we look at actual outcomes in terms of production and yield.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To measure expectations, we simply asked farmers if they harvested as much
 maize from the plot as what they expected expected.
 We also measure production on the randomly selected plot.
 We look at total production, but also at productivity by dividing production
 of the plot by the size of the plot.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results are reported in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Treatment-effects-expect"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 We again report control group means and baseline balance in the first 2
 columns.
 At baseline, we did not ask if expectations were met on the randomly selected
 plot.
 Therefore we report the average in the control group at midline and we
 do not test for baseline balance.
 Note that a large majority of farmers indicated that they harvested less
 than expected.

Column (3) shows that in the treatment group, a significantly higher share
 of farmers than in the control group say that what they produced was also
 what they expected.
 This is even more so for the subset of farmers that adopted at baseline
 (column (4)).
 At endline, there is no difference between treatment and control anymore
 (columns (5) and (6)).
 This pattern suggests that a subset of farmers indeed started out with
 inflated expectations, and this was corrected after they learned that improved
 seed is not miracle seed.

Finally, the table shows that the average control group farmer cultivates
 about 470 kg on the random plot.
 The random plot seems to be on average slightly larger than one acre, such
 that productivity is about 440 kg per acre.
 The intervention does not seem to have any impact on production of productivity.

\begin_layout Standard
This paper is motivated by qualitative evidence that some farmers appear
 to overestimate the potential benefits of certain improved agricultural
 technologies.
 The cost of a particular modern commercial input that a farmer wants to
 start using, such as improved seed varieties or inorganic fertilizers,
 is often substantial and competes with other (complementary) agricultural
 inputs.
 Furthermore, modern inputs are generally marketed with a focus on a few
 dimensions (eg seed that is treated against certain types of weed), and
 so farmers may reduce inputs (like herbicides) and efforts (like manual
 weeding) related to this dimension.
 However, to get the most out of improved technologies, it is important
 to also use complementary inputs and proper agronomic practices, otherwise
 outcomes may not be as expected.
 If farmers incorrectly attribute disappointing outcomes to the technology
 itself rather than improper use, this could lead to a pattern where farmers
 who try out a new technology switch back to local seed in the next season.
 In a sample of maize smallholder farmers in Uganda, we indeed see substantial
 dis-adoption over time.
 Furthermore, a large majority of farmers indicate that they expected higher
 yields from their plots.

\begin_layout Standard
To credibly test the hypothesis that farmers think of improved seed varieties
 are

\end_inset

, we set up a field experiment around an engaging video on recommended cultivati
on practices for maize growing that was shown to farmers before the planting
 season at the time when farmer select the seed that they will use.
 Two versions of the video were produced: one control video and one treatment
 video.
 The treatment video was essentially the same video as the control video,
 expect that in the treatment video, after each practice or input that was
 shown, it was explicitly mentioned that this is

also important when you are using improved seed varieties such as hybrid
 seed or OPVs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 We then randomly allocate treatment and control status to villages, where
 a set of farmers are then shown the corresponding video.
 We revisited farmers in treatment and control villages a first time after
 one season and a second time after a second agricultural season to test
 if there were differences farmer knowledge, seed use, complementary input
 use and agronomic practices, and expectations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first test if farmers pick up the subtle messages that lie at the heart
 of our light touch information treatment.
 To do so, we subject farmers to a multiple choice quiz.
 While we do not find average treatment effects that differ significantly
 from zero, we do see that all coefficients are going into the expected
 direction.
 We suspect that the lack of statistical significance may be due to the
 already high knowledge at baseline.
 However, even when most farmers already possess the knowledge, the treatment
 may still serve to make this knowledge more salient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Turning to the main outcome—behavior related to seed use—we find that in
 the season immediately following the treatment, treated farmers are less
 likely to use improved seed obtained from agro-input dealers and revert
 back to farmer saved landraces.
 In line with our expectations, this switching back to landraces is only
 short lived: in the next season, there is no difference between treatment
 and control groups anymore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To see if the main impact pathway is through the budget constraint, we look
 at complementary input use.
 We find little evidence that the intervention increased input use or the
 use of recommended practices.
 If anything, we actually see that at midline, the use of inputs in the
 treatment group is lower than in the control.
 However, if we restrict the sample to farmers that dis-adopt at midline
 and adopt again at endline, we do see an increase in input use at endline.
 Another intermediate outcome is related to expectations.
 We find that farmers that received the treatment are more likely to report
 at midline that what they harvested in in line with what they expected.

Our results differ from various other studies that find that improved technology
 enhances agricultural productivity by crowding in modern inputs and cultivation
 practices

 The reason for these opposite effects may be due to the fact that

 an income effect in the sense that money that is not used to buy seed can
 now be used to buy other inputs.

 do discuss the possibility that their effects are driven by an income effect.
 However, under income effect, they understand the effect of the additional
 income resulting from the adoption of the technology (a flood tolerant
 seed variety).
 The income effect we are concerned about is the one that is due to the
 fact that farmers receive seed for free, potentially freeing up money for
 other investments.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In our experiment, no free seed is provided, so when the adoption decision
 is made, farmers have take into account the additional cost of seed and
 the fact that expensive complementary inputs will need to be purchased,
 leading to dis-adoption.

Our study casts doubt on the suggestion that bayesian learning via sequential
 adoption can be a successful strategy for smallholder farmers in the long
 run

.
 If important interaction effects between different inputs are present,
 it is unlikely that farmers can try out all possible combinations of inputs
 to learn about these interactions.
 Furthermore, if farmers can not learn about the interactions, expectations
 may be incorrect, leading to sub-optimal adoption patterns, further complicatin
g learning.

Our study also has important implications for both policy markers and the
 private sector.
 When designing agricultural extension and advisory services, policy makers
 should highlight the complementary of modern inputs.
 If not, their efforts risk to be short lived.
 Worse, false perceptions of poor seed quality may crowd out the market
 for quality seed

 These days, policy makers often focus on subsidizing While this may work
 for some stand-alone technologies

\end_inset

, promoting other technologies that require complementary inputs (such as
 the use of subsidized or even free seed trial packs) may be counterproductive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is also a role for industry.
 As part of their marketing strategy, seed producers and agro-input dealers
 tend to highlight particular traits of the technology they use, such as
 high yields.
 Furthermore, they may not be tempted to actively promote the use of complementa
ry inputs if they are produced by companies that target the same customers
 as they do.
 In both cases, short term benefits may lead to long run losses.
