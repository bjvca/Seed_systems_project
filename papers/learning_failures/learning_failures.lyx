Miracle Seed: Biased Expectations, Complementary Input Use, and the Dynamics
 of Smallholder Technology Adoption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Farmers that try out agricultural technologies, such as improved seed varieties
 obtained from agro-input dealers, may hold unrealistic expectations about
 this technology.
 The fact that they paid a significant price for certain traits of the technolog
y, such as higher yield or pest resistance, may lead them to invest less
 in complementary inputs such as fertilizer or pesticides and reduce management
 practices such weeding.
 Subsequent disappointment about the performance of the technology may then
 be erroneously attributed to the technology itself, resulting in disadoption.
 We provide a simple model of technology adoption and test its predictions
 using a field experiment among 3,500 smallholder maize farmers in Uganda.
 In the experiment, a treatment group gets explicit information on the importanc
e of combining improved technologies and recommended farming practices.
 We find some evidence that in the short run, our message scares farmers
 away from commercial seed, back to local land-races.
 There is further suggestive evidence that at least some farmers adjust
 expectations and move back into adoption in the longer run.
 We conclude that policy makers and industry should focus on technology
 adoption as a package of complementary inputs and efforts, instead of marketing
 a single technology.

 To achieve this objective, much is expected from new technologies, especially

 At the same time, due to the climate crisis, agricultural production will
 become, more challenging.
 Also in this context, seed varieties that are selected to be more resilient
 are thought to be at least part of the solution

Unfortunately, the adoption of such technologies is lagging in areas where
 it has the largest potential.
 Recent trends in agricultural productivity in Africa reflect how technological
 progress has stagnated on the continent 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "10.1257/jep.36.1.33"

\end_inset

.
 Underlying this general stagnation is significant heterogeneity.
 For instance, at the micro level, we often observe disadoption, where farmers
 choose to switch back to technologies they have been using for ages after
 trying out a new technology once or twice

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many reasons why farmers do not move into a state of consistent
 adoption.
 One obvious reason why farmers stop using an input is because the inputs
 that were previously used were simply not available anymore

key "https://doi.org/10.1111/agec.12175"

 Farmers may also have learned over time that a particular technology is
 not suitable for them or does not meet their expectations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "CUSTODIO201619"

\end_inset

 Heterogeneity in the quality of the input, coupled with the fact that it
 is often hard to judge the quality of the input ex-ante, may also result
 in disadoption

 Farmers that are faced with credit constraints or face additional risk
 may also reconsider past adoption behavior

key "karlan2014agricultural"

\end_inset

.
 In the longer run, general equilibrium effects due to the fact that more
 farmers use the new technology will also increase supply and reduce prices,
 leading farmers with higher marginal cost to exit

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we consider the possibility that farmers hold inflated expectatio
ns of inputs and they base future decisions on disappointing outcomes, leading
 to disadoption.
 These inflated expectations have their origin in the fact that monetary
 outlays are necessary for improved technologies, and farmers may consider
 this a signal that modern inputs are substitutes for other investments
 they would typically make.
 In reality, however, for improved technologies to reach full potential,
 equal or even additional complementary investments are necessary.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "https://doi.org/10.1111/agec.12721"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 show that farming with hybrid seed is far more costly than farming with
 traditional seeds.
 The extra production costs include seed costs, but also fertilizer costs
 as hybrid farming requires more chemical fertilizers to achieve significant
 yield improvement, and (hired) labor and land preparation costs as hybrid
 farming again requires more specific and complex cultivation techniques.
 Inflated expectations about the performance of improved technologies can
 have lasting impacts on adoption if farmers attribute poor outcomes to
 the technology, instead of to the reduced use of complementary inputs and
 effort.
 This learning failure is understandable: as many factors simultaneously
 affect yields, learning about the causal impact of a new technology from
 a single use instance is hard, and cognitive constrained farmers may pay
 attention to the wrong attributes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Over the years, we uncovered many anecdotes in a variety of contexts that
 point to this explanation.
 For instance, many farmers use (inorganic) fertilizer once and assume this
 will lead to lasting improves of their soil fertility; however, fertilizer
 need to be applied for each cropping cycle to be effective.
 In the context of seed, extension officers often complain that farmers
 consider the trial seed packs they provide as some kind of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

miracle seed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that they think they can just broadcast on their least fertile plots without
 further management and still get exceptional harvests.
 However, improved maize seed needs a lot of fertilizer, often leaving soil
 more depleted than when landraces are used.
 In the areas where our research is situated, striga (
\emph on
striga hermonthica
\emph default
), a parasitic weed that feeds on the roots of maize plants and cause stunted
 growth, is a serious problem.
 Unfortunately, striga proliferates in poor soils and as a result some farmers
 now believe that improved seed varieties are responsible for increased
 striga infestations on their fields.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We present a simple model of technology adoption that incorporates the above
 ideas.
 In this model, budget constrained farmers compare expected returns of an
 improved technology to business-as-usual.
 The new technology comes at a cost, while the traditional technology does
 not.
 Both technologies, though, require complementary inputs and effort that
 directly affect productivity, yet for farmers that experiment with the
 new technology, the new technology is considered a substitute for (some
 of the) other inputs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We test model predictions using a field experiment among maize farmers in
 eastern Uganda.
 At the heart of the field experiment is a light-touch information intervention
 that attempts to correct the perception that the improved technology is
 a substitute for other inputs and effort.
 In particular, we show farmers a short, engaging video on the use of improved
 agro-inputs and recommended management practices for maize growing.
 In a treatment group we essentially show the same video, except that in
 certain parts—for instance when the use of inorganic fertilizers is demonstrate
d or when weeding is explained—we highlight that these inputs and practices
 are also very important important when improved seed varies are used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start by testing if farmers are able to extract the relevant information
 from the treatment video by testing knowledge after two full seasons post
 intervention.
 We find some indications that more farmers in the treatment group are aware
 of the importance of combining inputs than in the control group.
 Turning to adoption behavior, we see that farmers in the treatment group
 are more likely to use seed saved from the previous season.
 If we confine attention to only farmers that adopted at baseline, we see
 that farmers that were exposed to the treatment video were also less likely
 to obtain seed from agro-input dealers, more likely to use landraces, and
 less likely to use improved seed varieties such as hybrids or Open Pollinated
 Varieties (OPVs).
 However, in the subsequent season, these differences between treatment
 and control groups have disappeared.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then look at some secondary outcomes to explore mechanisms at work behind
 the intervention.
 First, we test if the intervention has an effect on the use of complementary
 inputs such as fertilizer and pesticides, as well as on best practices
 in crop management such as row planting and weeding.
 We would have expected a positive impact here, at least in the longer run
 when farmers are given sufficient time realign their production decisions
 to the new knowledge, but we do not; statistical power may be an issue.
 Second, even in the absence of adjustments in complementary input use and
 practices, the intervention may still have lasting impacts if farmers'
 expectations become more realistic, and we do see that a larger share of
 farmers in the treatment group report that yields are what they expected
 than in the control group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our work has important implications for both public and private sector stakehold
ers.
 The main conclusion is that a more holistic approach is necessary when
 encouraging varietal turnover and adoption of improved seed varieties by
 smallholder farmers.
 Governments should provide (free or subsidized) innovation packages that
 include complementary inputs as well, instead of focusing on a single technolog
y such as for example seed trial packs.
 Agricultural advisory services should manage expectations of farmers with
 respect to modern agricultural inputs.
 Agro-input dealers should be careful when marketing individual products
 for a particular trait if their aim is to build a loyal customer base.

 Especially in applied microeconomic field experiments, researchers focus
 on a limited number of agricultural seasons, and are unable to fully appreciate
 the dynamics of technology adoption.
 However, a number of studies document significant levels of disadoption

At the core of our theoretical framework presented in the next sections
 is some kind of learning failure that leads to disadoption.
 Indeed, heterogeneity in farmer characteristics means that farmers need
 to learn if a technology is suitable for their specific case

 However, learning about a new technology is hard.
 It is often difficult to determine on beforehand what the quality of an
 input is based on observable characteristics, and some may even argue that
 many technologies are credence goods

 Ex-post, evaluation of a technology is also hard, as many factors, including
 some that are out of the control of the farmer such as weather conditions
 and pests, affect outcomes

 Generally, it is thought that farmers learn through a combination of own

One strand of the literature argues that experiential learning by farmers
 is through sequential adoption.
 In cases where technologies are bundled in packages, it is often observed
 that farmers sequentially adopt components of the package, rather than
 the entire package

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 argue that this is due to farmers employing a bayesian approach to learning,
 where farmers try to isolate the impact of a component of the package.
 However, there may be circumstances under which such a strategy is not
 optimal.
 Such a strategy does not allow the farmer to identify potential interaction
 effects between the inputs.
 Indeed, the reason why interventions are presented as a package probably
 means that interaction effects are not trivial.
 For instance,

 find that banana tissue culture, a technology to ensure banana plantlets
 are free from pests and diseases, leads to a 7% yield gain in Kenya.
 However, they also find that improving access to irrigation could lift
 yield gains above 20%.
 It seems unlikely that farmers follow a sequential learning path that allows
 for all possible interactions for the different technologies.
 Furthermore, behavioural constrains may also prevent farmers from effective
 learning; it may be that farmers are paying attention to the wrong attributes

When learning about a new technology, farmers will ex-post compare realized
 yields to the yields they expected at the time they made the decision to
 adopt.
 This information will then be used in subsequent adoption.
 The effect of expectation about future returns on a decision has been studied
 in the context of education.
 Both

 found that a video intervention that informs farmers about the returns
 on intensification investments in rice growing increased adoption in Uganda.
 In all these studies, it is assumed that expected returns are underestimated.
 In the present study, we expect the reverse: Farmers consider improved
 seed to be miracle seed and thus overestimate returns, leading to too much
 investment.
 Correcting these believes is expected to lead to less adoption in the short
 run, but more stable adoption for part of the farmer population in the
 long run.

Finally, our treatment comes in the form of short and engaging videos.

 show that farmers that were exposed to engaging videos similar to the one
 we use in the present study were performing signiﬁcantly better on a knowledge
 test, were more likely to apply recommended practices, and were more likely
 to use fertilizer than households that did not view the video.
 These same households also reported maize yields that were about 10 % higher
 than those that did not view the video.
 Our study also contributes to this literature in testing if video mediated
 information dissemination can also be used to transmitting subtle information.

 Landraces are assumed to be free, while hybrid seeds are procured at a

 In both profit functions, a range of complementary inputs such as inorganic

 Yield for landraces is a function of inputs used:

Y_{it}^{L}=Y_{it}\left(X_{it}^{L}\right)

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{d^{2}Y_{it}}{dX_{it}^{2}}<0$

 Yield for hybrid seed follows a similar function as landraces, but also
 adds a positive and constant seed premium 
\begin_inset Formula $(A>0)$

 However, the seed premium only applies when the farmer uses at least the
 same amount of complementary inputs as they would do when using landraces

However, there may be reasons why farmers reduce input use when they use
 hybrid seed.

 reduced by the cost of seed, resulting in lower yields:

When farmers would be able to, at least on average, predict the future,
 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(Y_{it+1}\right)=Y_{t+1}+\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon\sim N(0,\sigma)$
\end_inset

, the decision to adopt will depend on the difference in yield between hybrid
 and local seed, relative prices of the inputs, and yield response of inputs.
 We introduce farmer heterogeneity into the model by assuming that at least
 some farmer are not aware of the true relationship between 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{it}^{H}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{it}$
\end_inset

, but instead believe that 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(Y_{it+1}^{H}\right)=A+Y_{it}\left(X_{it}^{L}\right)$

 The credit constrained farmer's expected yield will then be:

The model in equation

 is restricted to decision making related to one season.
 However, farmers need to make these decisions each year, and farmers will
 use information gained from past experience to form expectations.
 Farmers who are not aware of the true relationship between 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{it}^{H}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{it}$
\end_inset

 and overadopt (for instance because of budget constraints or because of
 inflated expectations) will be disappointed once outcomes are revealed.
 Farmers may be unable to learn about the complex relationship between 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{it}^{H}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{it}$
\end_inset

 from limited experiential data.
 Instead, they may simply reduce their expectations of the seed markup,
 in the limit setting 
\begin_inset Formula $E(A)=0$
\end_inset

, leading the farmer to disadopt in the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model leads to different farmer types based on their dynamic profile
 and knowledge.
 First, there will be a group of farmers that are knowledgeable about the
 true relationship between 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{it}^{H}$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{it}$
\end_inset

in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, and as a result have expectations that match production outcomes.
 For at least part of these farmers, the marginal cost of adoption is lower
 than the expected marginal return in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 strategy, while for another subset of these farmers, the marginal cost
 of adoption is higher than the expected marginal return, and so they will
 never adopt.
 Providing information about the complementary between improved seed and
 inputs will have no effect on these farmers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A next subset of farmers does not know the true relationship between 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{it}^{H}$

 A subset of these farmers does not adopt because their marginal cost of
 adoption exceeds the expected marginal returns.
 Providing information to these farmers may lead them to reconsider, conditional
 on this new information.
 Another subset of these farmers does adopt because their marginal cost
 of adoption is lower than the expected marginal returns.
 Providing information to these farmers may lead them to disadopt in the
 short run conditional on this new information.

While both subgroups likely respond to provision of new information, in
 this paper we are mainly concerned with the second group and consider farmers
 that adopt at baseline as an important group when looking at treatment
 heterogeneity.
 This is because this group already shows interest in adoption.
 In the former group, we suspected that the treatment effect will likely
 be attenuated by a large group of

\begin_layout Section
The experiment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model predictions were tested using a field experiment.
 The field experiment itself was part of a larger project on quality related
 constraints to technology adoption that also had interventions at the agro-inpu
t dealer level.
 The pre-analysis plan for the larger study, which has a section for the
 farmer level intervention we focus on in this paper, was pre-registered
 at the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "AEA RCT registry"
target "https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/6361"

\end_inset

.
 We describe the study population and the treatments below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Study population
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The field experiment was implemented in eastern Uganda, an area know for
 its maize production.
 Maize is considered both a food and cash crop in that area.
 As a matter of fact, much of the maize that is used as food aid in Sudan
 is sourced from here.
 As this study was part of a larger study that involved seed supply chains,
 smallholder farmers were drawn from the catchment areas of agro input dealers.
 As such, farmers should have reasonable access to improved seed varieties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Baseline data was collected from dealers in September and October 2020 and
 from farmers in April 2021.
 Midline data was collected in January and February 2022, and endline data
 was collected in July and August 2022.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The treatment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The treatment was implemented using short, engaging videos, shown to the
 farmers on tablet computers.
 Based on extensive interviews with experts, we developed a script that
 served as a basis for a video about best practices in maize cultivation.
 The video starts off with a couple (man and woman) in a healthy maize field
 inspecting their crops.
 The man narrates that they have been farmers for over ten years but that
 their maize fields have not always been this productive.
 He recounts how they used to struggle to feed their children, but that
 over time, they learned how to grow more maize.
 The secret of their success, they continue, lies in the adoption of improved
 technologies and best practices, such as the use of organic fertilizer,
 and optimal plant spacing and reduced seed rates.
 Furthermore, they argue that the use of improved seed and fertilizer also
 contributed significantly to increased production.
 They conclude this introduction by stating that they are proud to be successful
 farmers that can feed their families and even have some marketable surplus
 that they can sell on the market.
 The viewer is then invited to become a successful farmer as well by paying
 close attention as the role model farmers explain in detail the most important
 inputs and practices that transformed their lives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After this introduction, a poorly managed maize field is shown.
 Maize growth is stunted because of striga infestation.
 It is explained that this was how their garden looked in the past, when
 they thought weeding was a waste of time, improved seed was too expensive,
 and soil does not need fertilizer.
 But after a particularly bad season, they suffered and decided things needed
 to change.
 It is then shown how crop residue and animal dung is used to make organic
 manure, and how this is applied to the field.
 It is advised to start field preparations early, as timely planting (immediatel
y after the first rains) is very important to get good yields.
 The focus then shifts to row planting, where the recommended spacing of
 one foot between plants and 2.5 feet between rows is demonstrated.
 The role model farmers also mention the expected increase in yield from
 row planting.
 At this stage, it is also recommended to add inorganic fertilizer (Di-ammonium
 Phosphate).
 It is then shown that one seed of a common hybrid seed is place in each
 hill.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The video then proceeds by recommending resowing of hills where seed did
 not germinate after 10 to 12 days to keep optimal plant density.
 The actor in the video then notes that weeding is especially important
 in the first 40 days, as maize does not compete well for light and nutrients.
 It is recommended to start a first round of weeding 18 to 20 days after
 planting.
 It is also mentioned that at this stage, removal of striga is very important
 as the weed has not reached the roots of the maize plant yet and damage
 can still be avoided.
 A second round of weeding is recommended 2 to 3 weeks later.
 Four weeks after planting, when maize is knee high, it is demonstrated
 how another type of inorganic fertilizer (Urea) is applied as top dressing.
 Around the tasseling stage, a final round of weeding is recommended.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The treatment was implemented in the form of two variations of this video.
 The control video is essentially the video as described above.
 In the treatment video, we added subtle messages that recommended practices
 and inputs that feature in the video are particularly important when the
 farmer uses improved seed varieties.
 The only difference between the treatment and control video is thus that
 the former makes explicit the fact that significant complementarities exist
 between improved seed varieties and the recommended inputs and practices.
 The treatment video is about 12 minutes long and can be found 
\begin_inset CommandInset href

 group, the other half to the treatment group.

\begin_layout Standard
Our sample consists of smallholder maize farmers who live in the catchment
 areas of at least one or more agro-input dealers.
 We started by listing all agro-input shops in 11 districts in southeastern
 Uganda, which roughly corresponds to the Busoga kingdom, an exercise that
 let to about 350 agro-input dealers.
 We then asked these agro-input dealers about the locations of their customers.
 Enumerators were then instructed to randomly sample ten households that
 grow maize in these locations.
 Consequently, about 3,500 smallholder maize farmers were sampled.
 Confining attention to farmers that were interviewed at all survey rounds,
 we remain with a balanced panel of about 3,400 farmers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this study define smallholder adoption of an improved seed variety as
 follows: For each farmer in the sample, we asked on how many plots the
 farmer cultivated maize in the preceding season.
 From these plots, we than randomly select one plot on which detailed questions
 are asked on input use and cultivation practices.
 A farmer is assumed to be an adopter if they use fresh hybrid seed or an
 OPV that was recycled less than four times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 provides a visual representation of the evolution of improved seed adoption
 among farmers in our survey.
 We see that the share of adopters slowly increases over time: At baseline,
 we find that about 45 percent of farmers report to have adopted improved
 maize seed varies on the randomly selected plot.
 At midline, this figure has already increased to about 50 percent.
 At endline, the share of adopters is 54 percent of farmers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The figure also shows interesting dynamics.
 At the top of the figure, we see a substantial share of households (22
 percent) that adopted in all three surveys.
 These could be considered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 At the bottom of the chart, we find and equally substantial share (23 percent
 of households) that can similarly be categorized as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

never adopting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 However, we also see that a large group of farmers that adopt at baseline
 revert to local seed at midline (16 percent) or still adopt at midline
 but eventually also disadopt (7 percent).
 Fortunately, large groups of households also enter into adoption.
 We see that 19 percent of non-adopting households are adopting at midline
 and 12 percent of households that are not adopting at both base- and mildine
 become adopters at endline.
 Finally, there are also some households that seem to be moving in and out
 of adoption (8 percent) or moving out and back into adoption (9 percent).

 One in four indicates that they will not use the seed again in the future.

Differences between treatment and control are estimated in a regression

\begin_layout Subsection
Impact on knowledge
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first test if farmers were able to pick up the subtle messages hidden
 in the treatment video.
 This was done through as small quiz where farmers need to select the response
 that they feel is most appropriate from a set of alternative answers that
 were read to them by the enumerators.
 The quiz was only implemented at endline because we were wary of priming
 effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start with a general question, asking if farmers think recommended cultivatio
n practices like weeding and application of fertilizer is less, equally,
 or more important when using quality maize seed like OPV or hybrid seed.
 This is followed up by a more specific question, asking the farmer to indicate
 what applies for weeding when they are using hybrid seed.
 The options from which the farmer can choose are: 1) You do not need to
 weed and remove striga because hybrid seed varieties are treated to resist
 weed infestation; 2) You do not need to weed and remove striga in the first
 four weeks because hybrid seed is better at competing for sun, nutrients
 and water than normal seed; 3) You need to weed and remove striga just
 as you would with normal seed because maize seed does not compete well
 for sunlight, water and nutrients.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have a similar question for fertilizer application when hybrid seeds
 are used.
 The options here are that 1) You do not need to use inorganic fertilizer
 because you already bought seed.
 2) You can use less fertilizer than you normally would since improved maize
 seed grows faster 3) You need to use the amount of fertilizer that you
 would with normal seed because also improved seed varieties need nutrition;
 4) You should use more fertilizer than you would normally use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then have a question that checks if farmers use sub-optimal plots by
 asking which plots are best suited to plant improved seed on.
 The options here are 1) that it is best to save improved seed for poor
 plots, as these need less nutrients; 2) that is best to use your improved
 seed for plots that are furthest away from the home, as improved seed need
 less care than normal seed; and 3) that the decision on what plot to plant
 improved seed should not be affected by the seed type that is used.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another question tests if farmers think it is better to combine inputs,
 or to put all eggs in one basket.
 The question simply asks how to best invest money in agriculture.
 The options are that 1) It is best to invest all your money in seed, because
 poor seed quality is the main cause of low yields; 2) It is best to invest
 all your money in fertilizer, because poor soil is the main cause of low
 yields; and 3) It is best to buy both fertilizer and seed, because good
 seed without fertilizer does not give good results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we included a control questions, where we do not expect a difference
 between treatment and control because the answer featured in both treatment
 and control videos.
 In particular, we ask about the optimal spacing and seed rate for maize.
 The options are 1) One foot between plants and 2 and ½ foot between rows
 with one seed per hill; 2) One foot between plants and 2 and ½ foot between
 rows with two seeds per hill; and 3) Two foot between plants and 2 and
 ½ foot between rows with two seeds per hill.

 The first column (1) in the table provides the mean in the control group
 (and standard deviations in brackets below), mainly to get an idea of the
 effect size of the intervention.
 We see that knowledge is already high: for example, 88 percent of farmers
 in the control farmers know that recommended cultivation practices like
 weeding and application of fertilizer is also important when using improved
 seed.

The second column (2) shows the estimated difference between treatment and
 control at endline, while the third column (3) shows the estimated difference
 between treatment and control at endline, but only for the subset of farmers
 that report to be adopting improved seed varieties at baseline.
 As mentioned in Section

, we look at treatment heterogeneity at this level because the treatment
 is likely not relevant to all farmers: some farmers may not adopt because
 of other reasons than the ones we conjecture and so the treatment is unlikely
 to be effective.
 For instance, they may simply not have access to seed, or access to credit
 may be the primary constraint.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We see that knowledge, as measured by the quiz, has increased for most of
 the relevant questions, except for the control question.
 For instance, the share of farmers that knows complementary inputs and
 practices are at least as important when using improved seed increased
 from 88 percent to 90.2 percent.
 Furthermore, the share of farmers that recommends investing in different
 inputs (as opposed to investing all their money in only one input), increases
 from 75 percent to to 77.2 percent.
 If we only consider farmers that adopted at baseline, the increase over
 the control amounts to almost 5 percentage points.
 Unfortunately, after adjusting standard errors for clustering at the village
 level, none of the differences is statistically significant at conventional
 levels.
 This may be due to the fact that, ex-post, it turned out that many of the
 farmers were already able to indicate the correct response, and hence there
 is little scope for further improvement.
 At the same time, we note that all coefficient estimates are going in the
 same direction.
 Furthermore, even though farmers may possess the knowledge, there is still
 a difference between knowing and acting.
 We suspect that our intervention does not only increase knowledge, but
 also nudges farmer to practice what they know.
 Such aspirational effects are common in other studies that use videos featuring
 role models

Impact of treatment on adoption dynamics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now test the main hypothesis of this paper—that farmers that were made
 aware of the fact that improved seed also need complementary inputs—behave
 differently in terms of seed use in subsequent seasons.
 In particular, we look at use of fresh improved seed varieties (our key
 adoption indicator that was also used in Figure

 to illustrate the dynamics of technology adoption).
 However, we also look at other outcomes that are often partly overlapping
 or related.
 For instance, we also look at the use of landraces, which is to some extent
 the opposite of technology adoption (but not completely because many farmer
 also recycle hybrid seed).
 We also test whether there are differences in the use of recycled seed
 between the treatment and control group.
 A related outcome is the the share of farmers that buy from agro-input
 dealers.
 The four outcomes are also combined in an index following

.
 The first column (1) of the table shows sample means at baseline for the
 five outcomes (and standard deviations in brackets below).
 For instance, we see that 46 percent of farmers use improved seed varieties
 and that one third of farmers report that the seed that they planted on
 the randomly selected plot was obtained from an agro-input dealer.

 The second column (2) shows balance and compares treatment and control
 outcomes at baseline.
 We see that the randomization was successful, as there is no difference
 in seed adoption behavior between outcomes of farmers that will be exposed
 to the treatment and those that will not.
 The third column (3) shows the difference between treatment and control
 at midline, after households in the treatment group received treatment.
 Our theory suggests that in response to being sensitized about the importance
 of using complementary inputs and cultivation practices, less farmers would
 use improved seed varieties from agro-input dealers, and revert to farmer
 saved landraces.
 We find that the coefficients go in the right direction, however, we only
 find a significant difference for the share of farmers that planted recycled
 seed at midline.

 reports difference between treatment and control for outcomes at midline;
  fourth column (4) reports difference between treatment and control for
 outcomes at midline for farmers that adopt at baseline; fifth column (5)

The differences in the third column are for all farmers, while the fourth
 column (4) restricts the sample to only farmers that adopted at baseline.
 We see that effects become stronger if we restrict attention to this subgroup.
 We now see that farmers that were exposed to the treatment are almost 6
 percentage points less likely to adopt improved seed, and 5 percentage
 points more likely to revert to landraces.
 We see a particularly strong increase in the share of farmers that uses
 seed recycled from the previous harvest in the treatment group and a somewhat
 lower but still significant reduction in farmer that bought seed from an
 agro-input dealer.
 For the subgroup of farmers that adopted in at baseline, the adoption index
 is now also significantly negative for the treated farmers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fifth column (5) shows the difference between treatment and control
 at endline, after households received treatment a second time, while the
 sixth column (6) repeats this analysis but only for farmers who report
 adopting at baseline.
 At endline, differences between treatment and control seemed to have disappeare
d, suggesting that the disadoption effect is only temporary.
 This may be because farmers have moved to a new equilibrium where they
 are now more likely to become always adopters.

\begin_layout Subsection
Causal mechanisms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section,we investigate how the interventions affect the use of inputs
 and cultivation practices other than improved seed varieties, and expectations,
 as these are important variables in our theoretical model of Section

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Complementary inputs use and cultivation practices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effect of making farmers aware that improved seed needs the same complementa
ry inputs and effort than normal seed on the actual use of complementary
 inputs and practices is not clear a-priori.
 On the one hand, the intervention advocates for the use of complementary
 inputs and practices, and so one may expect that adopters increase use
 in the future as they adjust their practices to this new knowledge.
 However, we see that the first order response of the average farmer is
 to reduce the use of improved seed, which may offset the increased use
 of complementary inputs, at least in the short run.
 However, in subsequent seasons, when farmers adopt again, one would expect
 that at least some treatment farmers now also use more complementary inputs
 and put in more effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We look at a range of practices and inputs in line with what is featured
 in both treatment and control videos.
 A first outcome is an indicator for single-stand row-planting.
 Row planing is an important management practice that can lead to significant
 yield gains.
 Under row planting, space is used optimally and plants have sufficient
 nutrients and sunlight.
 However, row planting increases workload, hence farmers often engage in
 broadcasting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second outcome is the recommendation to reduce seed rate.
 Farmers often plant more seed than necessary because they fear that seed
 may not germinate.
 However, using more than 2 seeds per hill leads to stunted maize growth
 due to competition for light and nutrients.
 At the same time, just as for row-planting, a lower seed rate may increase
 the workload, as farmers may need to engage in gap filling after one week
 if seed fails to germinate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next three outcomes look at fertilizer use.
 Organic fertilizer application is important for soil structure, while DAP
 and Urea are used to provide maize essential nutrients at particular points
 in time.
 The cost of organic fertilizer is mainly in terms of labour, while both
 DAP and Urea needs to be bought from an agro-input shop and applied during
 planting (DAP) and at early stage of growth (Urea).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Weeding should be done within one week of planting and as often as possible.
 Official recommendations are to weed at least three times.
 Furthermore, invasive insects such as fall armyworm (
\emph on
Spodoptera frugiperda
\emph default
) or maize stalk borer (
\emph on
Busseola fusca
\emph default
) can severely reduce yields.
 Pesticides, including insecticides, are widely available in agro-input
 shops under commercial names such as Rocket,, Lalafos and Dudu acelamectin,
 and used buy many farmers.
 While weeding requires labour that can potentially be supplied by household
 members, pesticides comes at a pecuniary cost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we also look at differences in resowing or gap-filling.
 This involves revisiting the field after about one week and inspecting
 hills for seed germination.
 When a seed did not germinate, new seeds are planted in that location.
 Gap-filling, seed rate and row planting are thus likely correlated.
 We also combine all outcomes into an overall index of practices following

  fourth column (4) reports difference between treatment and control for

\end_inset

.
 As in previous tables, the first two columns ((1) and (2)), show control
 group means and orthogonality tests for outcomes before the treatment.
 Interestingly, we find some imbalance on the number of times that farmers
 report to have been weeding the randomly selected plot and the likelihood
 that farmers resow after one week.
 Note that the imbalance is in different directions, which makes it less
 likely that the imbalance is due to structural difference between treatment
 and control group such as lower effort in one group, but is likely to be
 the result of chance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At midline, column (3) shows that farmers do not use more inputs or put
 in more effort; on the contrary (and especially if we only consider a subset
 of farmers that adopted at baseline in column (4)) farmers appear to be
 less likely to engage in row planting and less likely to use DAP.
 However, according to the index, there is no overall effect of the intervention
 on input use and recommended cultivation practices at midline.
 After a second season (when the negative effect on improved seed use for
 treated farmers has disappears — see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Treatment-effects"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) we also do not find a consistent increase in input use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above results may indicate that farmers' response to the treatment is
 limited to decisions related to seed.
 However, it may also be that we lack power as a result to heterogeneous
 treatment effects.
 For instance, our theoretical model predicts a positive effect at endline
 only for farmers that adopt at baseline, disadopt at midline and are responsive
 to the treatment (that is, they are not already aware of the importance
 of using improved seed, which is likely the case for always adopters).
 If we compare treatment and control farmers for the subset of farmers that
 adopts at baseline, does not adopt at midline, and adopt again at endline,
 we do indeed find that treated farmers use more fertilizer and pesticides
 and the index is significant at the 10 percent level.
 However, such comparisons are likely to suffer from endogeneity bias, as
 the treatment affects adoption decisions at both mid- and endline.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
expectations and outcomes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To measure expectations, we simply asked farmers if they harvested as much
 maize from the plot as what they expected expected.
 We also measure production on the randomly selected plot.
 We look at total production, but also at productivity by dividing production
 of the plot by the size of the plot.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results are reported in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Treatment-effects-expect"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 We again report control group means and baseline balance in the first two
 columns ((1) and (2)).
 At baseline, we did not ask if expectations were met on the randomly selected
 plot.
 Therefore we report the average in the control group at midline and we
 do not test for baseline balance.
 Note that a large majority of farmers indicated that they harvested less
 than expected.

Column (3) shows that in the treatment group, a significantly higher share
 of farmers than in the control group say that what they produced was also
 what they expected.
 This is even more so for the subset of farmers that adopted at baseline
 (column (4)).
 At endline, there is no difference between treatment and control anymore
 (columns (5) and (6)).
 This pattern suggests that a subset of farmers indeed started out with
 inflated expectations, and this was corrected after they learned that improved
 seed is not miracle seed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the table shows that the average control group farmer cultivates
 about 470 kg on the random plot.
 The random plot seems to be on average slightly larger than one acre, such
 that productivity is about 440 kg per acre.
 The intervention does not seem to have any impact on production or productivity.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper was motivated by qualitative evidence that many farmers appear
 to overestimate the potential benefits of certain improved agricultural
 technologies.
 The cost of a particular modern commercial input that a farmer wants to
 start using, such as improved seed varieties or inorganic fertilizers,
 is often substantial and competes with other (complementary) agricultural
 inputs.
 Furthermore, modern inputs are generally marketed with a focus on a few
 dimensions (eg seed that is treated against certain types of weed), and
 so farmers may reduce inputs (like herbicides) and efforts (like manual
 weeding) related to this dimension.
 However, to get the most out of improved technologies, it is important
 to also use complementary inputs and proper agronomic practices, otherwise
 outcomes may be lower than expected.
 If farmers incorrectly attribute disappointing outcomes to the technology
 itself rather than improper use, this could lead to a pattern where farmers
 who try out a new technology switch back to local seed in the next season.
 In a sample of maize smallholder farmers in Uganda, we indeed see substantial
 disadoption over time.
 Furthermore, a large majority of farmers indicate that they expected higher
 yields from their plots.

\begin_layout Standard
To credibly test the hypothesis that farmers think of improved seed varieties
 are

\end_inset

, we set up a field experiment around an engaging video on recommended cultivati
on practices for maize growing that was shown to farmers before the planting
 season at the time when farmer select the seed that they will use.
 Two versions of the video were produced: one control video and one treatment
 video.
 The treatment video was essentially the same video as the control video,
 expect that in the treatment video, after each practice or input that was
 shown, it was explicitly mentioned that this is

also important when you are using improved seed varieties such as hybrid
 seed or OPVs

\end_inset

.
 We then randomly allocated treatment and control status to villages, where
 a set of farmers were then shown the corresponding video.
 We revisited farmers in treatment and control villages a first time after
 one agricultural season and a second time after a second season to test
 if there were differences in farmer knowledge, seed use, complementary
 input use and agronomic practices, and expectations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first tested if farmers picked up the subtle messages that lie at the
 heart of our light-touch information treatment.
 To do so, we subjected farmers to a multiple choice quiz.
 While we did not find average treatment effects that differed significantly
 from zero, we did see that all coefficients were going in the expected
 direction.
 We suspect that the lack of statistical significance may be due to the
 already high knowledge at baseline.
 However, even when most farmers already possess the knowledge, the treatment
 may still have made this knowledge more salient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Turning to the main outcome—behavior related to seed use—we found that in
 the season immediately following the treatment, treated farmers were less
 likely to use improved seed obtained from agro-input dealers and revert
 back to farmer saved landraces.
 In line with our expectations, this switching back to landraces was only
 short lived: in the next season, there was no difference between treatment
 and control groups anymore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To see if the main impact pathway runs through the budget constraint, we
 looked at complementary input use.
 We found little evidence that the intervention increased input use or the
 use of recommended practices.
 If anything, we actually saw that at midline, the use of inputs in the
 treatment group was lower than in the control.
 However, when we restricted the sample to farmers that disadopt at midline
 and adopt again at endline, we did see an increase in input use at endline.
 Another intermediate outcome is related to expectations.
 We found that farmers that received the treatment were more likely to report
 at midline that what they harvested was in line with what they expected.

Our results differ from various other studies that found that improved technolog
y increased agricultural productivity by crowding in modern inputs and cultivati
on practices

 The reason for these opposite effects may be due to the fact that

 and

 provided the improved technology (also seed) for free as part of there
 experiment, potentially resulting in an income effect in the sense that
 money that was not used to buy seed was used to buy complementary inputs.

 do discuss the possibility that their effects are driven by an income effect.
 However, under income effect, they understand the effect of the additional
 income resulting from the adoption of the technology (a flood tolerant
 seed variety).
 The income effect we are concerned about is the one that is due to the
 fact that farmers receive seed for free, potentially freeing up money for
 other investments.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In our experiment, no free seed was provided, so when the adoption decision
 was made, farmers had to take the additional cost of seed and the fact
 that expensive complementary inputs would need to be purchased into account,
 leading to disadoption.

\begin_layout Standard
Our study further casts doubt on the suggestion that bayesian learning via
 sequential adoption can be a successful strategy for smallholder farmers
 in the long run

\end_inset

.
 If important interaction effects between different inputs are present,
 it is unlikely that farmers can try out all possible combinations of inputs
 to learn about these interactions in a bayesian fashion.
 Furthermore, if farmers can not learn about the interactions, expectations
 may be incorrect, leading to sub-optimal adoption patterns, further complicatin
g learning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our study also has important implications for both policy markers and the
 private sector.
 When designing agricultural extension and advisory services, policy makers
 should highlight the complementarity of modern inputs.
 If not, their efforts risk to be short lived.
 Worse, false perceptions of poor quality may crowd out the market for quality
 inputs 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Policy makers often subsidize improved technologies to scale up adoption
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 While this may work for some stand-alone technologies

\end_inset

, promoting technologies that require complementary inputs (such as the
 use of subsidized or even free seed trial packs) may be counterproductive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is also a role for industry.
 As part of their marketing strategy, seed producers and agro-input dealers
 tend to highlight particular traits of the technology they use, such as
 high yields.
 Furthermore, they may not be tempted to actively promote the use of complementa
ry inputs if they are produced by companies that target the same customers
 as they do.
 In both cases, short term benefits may lead to long run losses.
