Miracle seeds: Biased expectations, complementary input use, and the dynamics
 of smallholder technology adoption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
To fully benefit from new agricultural technologies like improved seed varieties
, significant investment in complementary inputs such as fertilizers and
 pesticides, and practices such as systematic planting, irrigation, and
 weeding are also required.
 Farmers may fail to recognize the importance of these complements, leading
 to disappointing crop yields and outputs and, eventually, dis-adoption
 of the improved variety.
 Using a field experiment, we test an information intervention among smallholder
 maize farmers in eastern Uganda that points out these complimentarities
 and find that this leads to lower adoption in the treatment group.
 We rationalize this finding with a simple model where farmers have misspecified
 mental models of the technology production function.
 Consistent with the theoretical model, we find that most farmers in our
 sample believe in miracle seed, leading them to adopt less after they have
 been sensitized about the need to use complementary inputs to unlock the
 adoption premium.

To feed a growing population in an environmentally sustainable manner and
 in the midst of a long-term climate crisis, farmers throughout the developing

 To achieve this goal, much is expected from new technologies, especially
 from higher-yielding varieties that are resilient to pests, diseases, and
 other biotic stresses and are tolerant of droughts, floods, heat, and other
 abiotic stresses

Unfortunately, the adoption of such technologies is lagging in areas where
 they may have the biggest impact.
 Recent trends in agricultural productivity growth in Africa show that technolog
ical progress has largely stagnated on the continent

 However, significant heterogeneity underlies this general stagnation.
 For instance, at the micro level, we often observe dis-adoption patterns
 and trends, where farmers choose to switch back to technologies and inputs
 they have been using for decades after trying out a new technology once
 or twice

 are genetic innovations embodied in seed.
 We use the term

 technologies—and that each figures differently into our understanding of
 the conventional agricultural production function.

There are many reasons why farmers may not move into a state of sustained
 adoption of a given technology.
 For neoclassical explanations such as credit constraints or risk aversion,
 the reader is referred to the excellent reviews by

 In this paper, we take a more behavioral economics approach and consider
 the possibility that farmers hold inflated expectations of new technologies
 as an explanation for their dis-adoption.
 These inflated expectations result from the possibility that farmers may
 be unaware, fail to recognize, or downplay the importance of the need for
 substantial complementary investment.
 Indeed, for the new hybrid seeds suitable for East African maize farmers
 that came on the market a few decades ago, the promise to double or even
 triple yields could typically only be achieved in favorable climatic conditions
 and with the addition of fertilizer and other inputs

 show that farming with improved maize varieties is far more costly than
 farming with unimproved maize varieties.
 The additional production costs include not just the (higher) cost of seed
 but also higher fertilizer costs required to achieve expected yield improvement
s, as well as higher costs of labor for farm tasks that are associated with
 the cultivation of higher-yielding maize.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The impact of inflated expectations due to insufficient complementary input
 use on future adoption behavior is complex and depends on what the disappointed
 outcome is attributed to, and hence the learning that takes place.
 It is well known that learning about a new technology is hard: As multiple
 factors simultaneously affect yields and outputs, learning about the causal
 impact of a new technology from a single experience is difficult, especially
 if the technology performs only under specific or stochastic circumstances
 such as abiotic stress 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, or if the farmer is unable to learn in a Bayesian manner because it is
 too cognitively taxing 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, pays attention to the wrong attributes of the technology

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inflated expectations are likely to have a negative impact on future adoption
 if farmers attribute the disappointing outcomes to the seed itself.
 However, as there are different types of seed and quality of seed is known
 to vary, farmers may be tempted to try again at some point in the future,
 particularly if neighbors get better results and extension workers are
 promoting improved seed varieties.
 Alternatively, farmers may attribute the disappointing outcome to other
 factors such as weather events, in which case they are likely to adopt
 again in the future.
 Finally, if farmers attribute disappointing outcomes to the correct cause
 (insufficient complementary investment), farmers may re-optimize in light
 of the additional cost of complementary inputs and practices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many researchers working in developing-country agriculture will have their
 own anecdotal evidence of inflated expectations that illustrate the presence
 of biased expectations, sub-optimal complementary investments, and subsequent
 (temporary) dis-adoption when disappointing outcomes are attributed to
 the technology itself.
 For instance, researchers may be familiar with farmers' belief that using
 inorganic fertilizer for one cropping cycle will lead to long-lasting soil
 fertility improvements.
 Others may be familiar with another common belief among farmers—often promoted
 by extension agents and agro-dealers—that an improved variety is a

 Specifically, we show all farmers in our sample a short, engaging video
 about the use of improved inputs and recommended management practices for
 maize cultivation.
 In the treatment group, we show the same video, except that in certain
 points in the narration—for instance when the use of inorganic fertilizers
 is demonstrated or when weeding is explained—we highlight the particular
 importance of using additional inputs and performing certain management
 practices in conjunction with the improved variety, and manage expectations
 by stressing that farmers should not skimp on this input or practice because
 improved seed varieties are not

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first check whether farmers are able to extract the relevant information
 from the treatment video and find that farmers in the treatment group are
 better in selecting the correct answer in a quiz on the use of complementary
 investments.
 Turning to adoption behavior, we find, somewhat surprisingly, that farmers
 in the treatment group are less likely to adopt improved seed varieties
 than control group farmers.
 We find no evidence that the intervention affected the use of complementary
 inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides, or recommended practices for
 maize management such as weeding frequency and re-planting.
 We do see that among treated farmers, expectations with respect to yield
 of maize grown after the treatment tend to be more in line with realized
 output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To explain the negative impact of our information treatment on adoption,
 we develop a simple model of technology adoption.
 In this model, farmers compare the expected returns of an improved technology
 (seed) to their business-as-usual choices.
 The new technology comes at a cost, while the unimproved technology does
 not.
 Both technologies, though, require complementary inputs and efforts that
 directly affect productivity, with productivity gains from the new technology—t
he adoption premium—only materializing when complementary inputs and practices
 exceed business-as-usual levels for the unimproved technology.
 We then heterogeneity in the beliefs that farmers hold about the nature
 of the production function of the new technology: some farmers know that
 additional complementary inputs and practices are needed to obtain the
 adoption premium, other farmers believe in miracle seed an think that the
 adoption premium is also present if they apply complementary inputs and
 practices as they normally would.
 Finally, there is a group of farmers that does believe there is an adoption
 premium, perhaps because they have been disappointed in the past.
 The model is then used to derive predictions on the treatment effect for
 specific subgroups, and tested by estimating the treatment effect on subsamples
 of the data.
 Results suggest that a substantial share of our study population believes
 in miracle seed: they believe improved seed are profitable under a misspecified
 production function, but not when all costs of complementary inputs and
 practices are considered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These findings have implications for our understanding of smallholder technology
 adoption dynamics.
 If farmers do not use appropriate complementary inputs and practices when
 using improved maize varieties because they believe in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

miracle seeds
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, their yields are likely to be disappointing.
 Often, disappointment about the performance of a technology is then erroneously
 attributed to the technology itself, leading farmers to continue using
 local seed.
 In the aggregate, this is likely to lead to lower than optimal adoption.
 Correcting beliefs may prompt some of these disappointed farmers to re-evaluate
 costs and benefits of using improved seed, which may increase adoption.
 Additionally, providing this information upfront can save farmers from
 the disappointment and financial loss of failed attempts.
 Our findings also have policy implications: public and private actors in
 the agriculture sector need to promote new technologies as highly site-
 and context-specific combinations of technologies, inputs, practices, and
 efforts instead of single

Agricultural technology adoption is at the heart of a rich body of research
 on food security, poverty reduction, economic development, and structural
 transformation.
 Studies on the economics of technical change in agriculture go back to
 at least 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and are reviewed in widely cited articles such as

.
 More recently and with the proliferation of field experiments and randomized
 controlled trials, economic theories that explore alternative drivers of
 technology adoption have received greater empirical attention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of these studies (implicitly) assume that some kind of graduation model
 underlies the technical change process, wherein farmers switch from a low-level
 equilibrium to a high-level equilibrium in which technology use is sustained
 once initial conditions—typically, access to information or finance—are
 satisfied or binding constraints removed

 Yet most of these studies follow farmers across a limited number of agricultura
l seasons, and are unable to fully appreciate the dynamics of technology
 adoption over time.
 Only a few studies offer a longer-term perspective, documenting significant
 levels of dis-adoption

Such a pattern of adoption and dis-adoption is consistent with a model of
 learning failures, where farmers have inflated expectations about the returns
 to a new technology, but fail to uncover the true form of the production
 function through experience, leading to disappointment and subsequent dis-adopt
ion.
 Indeed, heterogeneity in farmer characteristics implies that farmers need
 to learn whether using a new technology is optimal for their specific context

 However, learning about a new technology is often difficult for reasons
 related to the technology's complexity and the observability of its quality
 or performance

One strand of the literature argues that sequential adoption leads to experienti
al learning by farmers.
 In cases where technologies are bundled in packages, it is often observed
 that farmers sequentially adopt components of the package, rather than
 adopting the entire package at once

 argue that this occurs when farmers employ a Bayesian approach to learning
 in which they try to isolate the impact of one component of the package
 at a time.
 However, there are circumstances under which this strategy is not optimal
 because it can prevent farmers from identifying potential synergies between
 technologies, inputs, and practices.
 Indeed, the reason why many interventions are presented as a package is
 because these interaction effects are not trivial.
 For instance,

 find that banana tissue culture, a technology to ensure that banana plantlets
 are free from pests and diseases, leads to a seven percent yield gain in
 Kenya.
 However, they also find that improving access to irrigation can lift yield
 gains above 20 percent.
 If many complementarities like this exist, it seems unlikely that farmers
 are in a position to follow a sequential learning path that allows for
 all possible interactions between the different technologies within a reasonabl
e time frame.
 Furthermore, as mentioned above, farmers may face certain behavioral constraint
s that inhibit their ability to learn about interaction effects if, for
 example, they pay attention to minor or tangential attributes of the package
 and miss the more important attributes

 Our study contributes to this literature by providing additional evidence
 on the limits of Bayesian learning in the context of agricultural technology
 adoption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another strand of the literature addresses the technology learning process
 in terms of how farmers compare realized yields against expected yields
 to inform their subsequent adoption decisions.
 The effect of incorrect expectations about future returns on decision-making
 has been studied most in the context of investments in education, but is
 readily applicable to technology adoption in agriculture.
 For example, both

Note that across these studies, it is assumed that the individual underestimates

In the present study we also use video as the main conduit for information
 transfer.
 In the video presented to the treatment group, we emphasized the crucial
 role of complementary inputs and efforts in maximizing the benefits of
 improved seed varieties.
 To isolate the effect of making complementary inputs and efforts more salient
 from just being exposed to the video, we also show a video that promotes
 best practices in maize growing using improved seed varieties to the control
 group (but does not explicitly points out the interaction with complementary
 inputs and effort).
 Our study contributes to this literature by testing if videos are also
 effective in conveying subtle messages.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test if providing information about the need for additional inputs and
 practices when using seed of an improved variety affects farmer behavior,
 we implemented a field experiment conducted with almost 3,500 maize farmers
 in eastern Uganda.
 The intervention consisted of screening short, engaging videos about best
 practices in maize cultivation.
 The videos were shown individually to participating farmers on tablet computers
 by specially trained field enumerators.
 The content of the video scripts was developed following extensive interviews
 with experts, including agricultural extension agents, plant breeders,
 seed producers, government officials, and farmers themselves.
 In this section, we provide a detailed description of the interventions
 and the empirical strategy used to answer the research question.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Intervention
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the heart of the field experiment is a video that opens with a woman
 and a man standing in a well-kept maize plot inspecting their crop.
 The couple explains that they have been farmers for more than ten years
 but that their fields have not always been productive.
 They recount how they used to struggle to feed their children, but that
 over time, they learned how to grow more maize on less land.
 The secret of their success, the couple continues, lies in the adoption
 of improved technologies and best practices, such as the use of organic
 fertilizer, optimal plant spacing, and reduced seed rates.
 Furthermore, they explain that especially the use of improved seed varieties
 such as hybrid seed or OPVs contributed significantly to increased production.
 They conclude this introduction by stating that they are proud to be successful
 farmers who can feed their families and even produce surpluses that they
 can sell in the market.
 The viewer is then invited to become equally successful in farming by paying
 close attention as the featured (role model) farmers explain in detail
 the most important technologies, inputs, and practices that transformed
 their lives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Experimental variation was obtained through two variations of this intervention
 video.
 The control group viewed the video as described above: The control video
 shows different recommended inputs and practices like row planting and
 inorganic fertilizer application but does not comment on the importance
 of combining improved seed varieties with complementary inputs and practices.
 The treatment group viewed a similar video, but now for each individual
 recommended input or practice it is made explicit that significant complementar
ities exist between improved varieties and recommended inputs and practices.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For example, in the control video, the farmer explains that: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

At planting time, I paid attention to recommended spacing, carefully measuring
 1 foot between plants and 2.5 feet between rows.
 I first dug a 4-inch deep hole and added 1 water bottle cap of Di-Ammonium
 Phosphate (DAP).
 Then I added some soil.
 Afterwards, I put 1 maize seed in and covered it with soil.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 In the treatment video, the farmer narrates the same scene but adds a pointed
 comment at the end of the exposition, stating: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did you know that recommended spacing and using DAP is even more important
 when using improved seeds?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Often, we also added a few sentences that aim to correct inflated expectations.
 For instance, when discussing the use of inorganic fertilizer, we warn
 the viewer that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Improved seed are not miracle seed! They also need proper fertilizer application
 to get the higher yields.” For the practice of gap filling two weeks after
 planting, we warn: “Do not assume that just because you used an improved
 seed variety, all seeds will germinate!”

\begin_layout Standard
By randomizing which video is viewed by our sampled farmers, we can isolate
 the causal effect of making salient that improved varieties do not substitute
 for inputs and effort, but in fact require more investment.
 The use of a control video has an additional advantage: since it is not
 clear to farmers or enumerators which video is the treatment and which
 is the control, we reduce the likelihood that results are driven by experimente
r demand effects

 Furthermore, to reduce the likelihood that treated households could provide

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experiment targeted the second agricultural season of 2021, where maize
 is planted in August and September and harvested in November and December.
 We implemented the treatment in April 2021, well before the start of the
 season, to ensure that farmers had the necessary information before making
 decisions on seed and input use.
 At this point in time, we also collected baseline data on our sample households.
 The intervention was repeated just before planting in August 2021, and
 post-treatment data was collected in January and February 2022.

 For outcome families with more than one outcome (knowledge, adoption, input
 use and effort), we compute outcome indices, which is a common way to account
 for multiple hypothesis testing.
 To do so, we follow

, where each index is computed as a weighted mean of the standardized values
 of the outcome variables.
 The weights are derived from the (inverse) covariance matrix, such that
 less weight is given to outcomes that are highly correlated with each other.
 For these indices, signs of outcomes were switched where necessary so that
 the positive direction always indicates a “better” outcome.

\begin_layout Subsection
Sample
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The field experiment was conducted in southeastern Uganda, an area known
 for its maize production by smallholder farmers where maize is considered
 both a food and cash crop.
 Because it was conducted as part of a larger study on maize seed supply
 chains, farmers were drawn from the market-sheds of agro-input shops.
 These shops sell agricultural inputs and technologies in countries with
 large smallholder farmer populations living in remote areas with relatively
 poor infrastructure.
 A reasonably dense network of semi-formal agro-input dealers provides access
 to seed, fertilizer, agro-chemicals, and tools, and sometimes agricultural
 advisory service and credit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sampling frame was developed as follows: first, we listed all agro-input
 shops in 11 districts in southeastern Uganda, resulting in the identification
 of 347 agro-input dealers.
 We then asked these dealers to identify the villages where most of their
 customers come from.
 This sampling frame allows us to assume that sampled farmers have both
 reasonable and similar access to improved maize varieties if they choose
 to adopt as a result of our intervention, and that other constraining factors
 such as seed quality, credit access, or individual preferences were similarly
 distributed across our treatment and control groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, field supervisors compiled household lists for each village and randomly
 sampled ten maize-cultivating households per village using systematic sampling
 (nth name selection technique).
 The enumerators interviewed 3,470 farmers using a household survey instrument
 that contained a wide range of questions about the individual, their household,
 and their farm.
 From an initial sample of 3,470 farmers who were interviewed in the baseline
 survey round, only 63 farmers dropped out in the subsequent survey round.
 We did not find that attrition differed significantly between treatment
 and control group, and thus proceed with the analysis on a balanced panel
 of 3,407 farmers.
\end_layout

Descriptive Statistics and Balance

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 provides descriptive statistics drawn from the baseline survey of the farmers
 in our sample.
 The first column reports means (and standard errors).
 For example, we see that 78% of household heads in our sample are male
 and the average household head is 49 years old.
 The average household consists of almost 9 members and use 3.3 acres of
 land for crop production.
 About half of the farmers in our sample indicate that they used seed of
 an improved variety on at least one plot in the season preceding the baseline
 survey, and 32.5 percent bought this seed at an agro-input shop.
 We further asked farmers to rate the quality of the seed they used in the
 previous season on a scale of 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent).
 We see that farmers rate the quality of the seed they use fairly high (3.4/5).
 Organic fertilizer use is very low at baseline.
 The average farmer harvested 500 kg of maize from one acre.
 About half of the farmers in our sample also sold maize.
\end_layout

Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 also serves to demonstrate baseline balance on a set of (pre-registered)
 variables.
 The second column shows the difference between treatment and control group
 means (and standard deviations below).
 We find only one significant difference (at the 10 percent level) which
 is what one would expect when 10 comparisons are made, hence we conclude
 that we have baseline balance between treatment and control groups.

The negative impact on adoption may seem counter-intuitive at first glance.
 Indeed, when we set up the experiment, we did not intend to reduce the
 adoption of seed of an improved variety.

A first group of farmers knows that, for the adoption premium to materialize,
 additional complementary inputs and practices are needed.
 From Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 exceeds the cost of the seed and additional complementary inputs needed
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\sum w_{t}X_{it}^{H}-\sum w_{t}X_{it}^{L}+b_{t}s_{it}^{*}\right)$

 Informing these farmers about the true shape of the production function
 will not have an effect on adoption of improved seed, or indeed, any other
 outcome we considered in Figure

\begin_layout Standard
A second group of farmers thinks that the adoption premium is not dependent
 on the use of complementary inputs and practices.
 They believe that that adoption premium is always present, that is 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{it+1}^{H}=A_{i}+Y_{it}\left(X_{it}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 According to Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\begin_inset Formula $\sum\frac{w_{t}}{E(p_{t+1})}X_{it}^{H}=\sum\frac{w_{t}}{E(p_{t+1})}X_{it}^{L}$

\begin_inset Formula $\left(b_{t}s_{it}^{*}\right)$

 Informing this group of farmers about the need for complementary inputs
 is likely to reduce the likelihood of adoption, as it increases the cost

In the context of our field experiment, farmers in the control group that
 do not adopt do so because even with a misspecified mental model that overestim
ates the benefit of using an improved seed variety, adoption is not profitable
 for them.
 Informing them about the true nature of the production function will not
 change their behavior, as the information only increases the cost side
 of the equation, making the use of improved seed even less appealing.
 Farmers that do adopt in the control group do so because the they believe
 the misspecified adoption premium exceeds the cost of the seed.
 Informing them about the true nature of the production function will reduce
 the likelihood of adoption, as the information increases the cost side
 of the equation.
 Only if the misspecified adoption premium is assumed to be large enough
 (that is exceeding the cost of the additional complementary inputs needed
 (including the seed and normalized by the price), farmers that adopt in
 the control group will also adopt after having been informed about the
 need to use complementary inputs.
 As such, the average treatment effect does not only depend on the share
 of farmers that hold correct or incorrect beliefs, but also on the technology
 and associated costs.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 For these farmers, we thus expect a positive effect of the intervention
 on knowledge and a negative effect on adoption.
 Furthermore, we do not expect a change in the use of complementary inputs
 and practices.
 We expect that farmers' expectations become more in line with reality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A third group of farmers also use misspecified mental models of the production
 function.
 This group of farmers does not believe that seed of an improved variety
 is any better than local seed, hence 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{it+1}^{H}=Y_{it}\left(X_{it}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This could be farmers that used to believe in miracle seed, but that after
 a negative experience with improved seed (either through own experimentation
 or through learning from peers) adjusted their expectations downward.
 Informing this group of farmers about the need for complementary inputs
 could increase the likelihood of adoption if they update their beliefs
 and after doing so the expected adoption premium 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(p_{t+1}A_{i}\left(X_{it}^{H}>X_{it}^{L}\right)\right)$

\begin_inset Formula $\left(\sum w_{t}X_{it}^{H}-\sum w_{t}X_{it}^{L}+b_{t}s_{it}^{*}\right)$

 For such farmers, we would expect an increase in knowledge, an increase
 in adoption, and an increase in the use of complementary inputs and practices.
 For this group of farmers, we do not expect a change in expectations.

This is because virtually all these farmers will be using local seed in

 This leads to a more homogeneous subsample of individuals who are responsive

Second, as an indicator for adoption premium expectations, we look at the
 distribution of expected yields for farmers that use an improved seed variety
 at baseline.
 Farmers that are in the lowest 33 percent of the distribution are categorized

 the highest 33 percent of the distribution are categorized as potentially
 overestimating the yield premium; the remainder are assumed to correctly
 estimate the yield premium.

 and particularly for the subgroup that adopted at baseline and also overestimat

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As indicated above, we test farmer knowledge by means of a short quiz.
 The quiz begins with a general question asking farmers whether they think
 recommended cultivation practices like weeding and fertilizer application
 are less, equally, or more important when using improved varieties.
 This is followed by a more specific multiple-choice question on a particular
 practice—weeding—when cultivating an improved variety.
 Response options are: (1) you do not need to weed because seed of improved
 varieties is treated to resist weed infestation; (2) you do not need to
 weed in the first four weeks because seed of improved varieties is better
 at competing for sun, nutrients, and water than normal seed; and (3) you
 need to weed just as you would with unimproved varieties because maize
 seed does not compete well for sunlight, water, and nutrients.
 The quiz contains a similar question about a key input as well—fertilizer—when
 cultivating an improved variety.
 The options here are: (1) you do not need to use inorganic fertilizer because
 you already purchased seed; (2) you can use less fertilizer than you normally
 would since seed of an improved maize variety grows faster; (3) you need
 to use the amount of fertilizer that you would with unimproved varieties
 because also seed of an improved variety needs nutrition; and (4) you should
 use more fertilizer than you would normally use.

 The first column (1) provides the mean in the control group (with standard

 We see that knowledge is already high, which is likely to reduce statistical
 power for these comparisons.

 adopt and overestimate production at baseline).

We can (and do) also estimate treatment effects for Type 1 and Type 5 farmers.

\begin_layout Standard
We find that knowledge, as measured by the quiz questions, increases for
 all variables (except for the control question), and generally more so
 for the subset of farmers that used an improved variety at baseline.
 For instance, the share of farmers that knows complementary inputs and
 practices are at least as important when using improved varieties increases
 from 87.1 to 89.3 percent.
 Furthermore, the share of farmers that recommends investing in different
 inputs (as opposed to investing all money in only one input), increases
 from 73.5 to 75.7 percent.
 If we only consider farmers that adopted at baseline, the increase over
 the control amounts to about 8 percent.
 Further restricting the sample to only Type 3 farmers leads to an average
 treatment effect of 12 percent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After adjusting standard errors for clustering at the village level, none
 of the differences for the entire sample is statistically significant at
 conventional levels.
 However, if we only consider the subset of farmers that adopted at baseline,
 we see that the intervention significantly increased overall knowledge
 (as measured by the index).
 This overall effect is driven by increased knowledge about optimal agricultural
 investments among treated farmers.
 If we single out Type 3 farmers, the index looses its significance.
 The fact that this happens despite a larger effect size for the variable
 that drives the result suggests statistical power issues due to small sample
 size.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start with the main hypothesis of this paper: whether farmers who were
 pointed out that improved varieties need substantial investment in complementar
y inputs and management practices behave differently in terms of seed use
 in subsequent seasons than farmers that were not similarly informed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, we determine if farmers adopted improved maize varieties.
 To do so, we asked farmers on how many plots they cultivated maize during
 the preceding season.
 From these plots, we randomly selected one plot and asked detailed questions
 about seed and varietal use, input use, and management practices.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The decision to ask detailed questions on only one (randomly selected) plot
 as opposed to asking details on all plots was made because there is generally
 high correlation between technology use, input use and management practices
 within a household.
 As such, we decided to increase the number of farmers at the expense of
 the number of plots as this would increase statistical power.
 That said, one may be worried that farmers use different seed on different
 plots, and if the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wrong
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 plot is chosen, a farmer that is actually an adopting farmer is categorized
 as a non-adopter.
 We investigated this issue further by using a different variable for adoption
 status, namely if the farmer used seed of an improved variety on any field,
 and results were very similar.
 Furthermore, selection of the plot happens only during baseline; at other
 surveys reference is made to the name of the plot that was randomly selected
 during baseline.
 Provided that farmers plant the same seed type on the same plot every season,
 this would also mean that adoption dynamics are not affected by the random
 selection process.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Based on the information collected, we then defined a farmer as an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Adopter
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if they used either non-recycled (newly purchased, not saved) seed of (a)
 a hybrid or (b) an open pollinated variety.
 All others were defined as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Non-adopters.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We acknowledge that this definition of adoption is not perfect.
 Seed of an open pollinated variety that has been recycled (saved) up to
 four times could still be considered as improved, and farmers using this
 seed could still be counted as adopters.
 However, we expect the problem of incorrect beliefs about 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

miracle seeds
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and biased expectations to be most pronounced when smallholders do not
 have experience with the seed.
 If farmers recycle and use seed several times, their beliefs about the
 relationship between efforts and the returns to improved varieties will
 become closer to reality as they learn from season to season.
 That is why this stricter definition is useful to answer the questions
 raised in this paper.
 Also, most of our results remain robust to different definitions of adoption.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 A second related outcome we consider is the use of recycled seed, which
 is defined as seed that a farmer has saved themselves or obtained from
 another farmer who saved it (for example, a neighbor or relative).
 Another third related outcome is the share of farmers that report having
 purchased seed from an agro-input shop.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results are summarized in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Treatment-effects"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Column (1) shows sample means of the four outcomes at baseline with standard
 deviations in the brackets below.
 We find that 44 percent of farmers use fresh seed of improved varieties
 and that one third of farmers reports that the seed that they planted on
 the randomly selected plot was obtained from an agro-input dealer.
 Column (2) shows the difference between treatment and control groups for
 outcomes after the intervention.
 Our theory suggests that in response to being sensitized about the importance
 of using complementary inputs and management practices when using an improved
 variety, some farmers (Types 3 and 6) will change their adoption behavior
 (Prediction 2 in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Theoretical-framework"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 A relatively large share of farmers that initially overestimated the probabilit
y of an adoption premium (Type 3) will dis-adopt as their expected marginal
 return is reduced by the treatment.
 A share of farmers that initially underestimated the returns to improved
 varieties (Type 6) may start adopting as their expected marginal return
 is increased by the treatment.
 We find that adoption, as measured by the index, significantly decreases
 for the entire sample.
 Furthermore, all coefficients move in the direction of dis-adoption.
 This implies that farmers are less likely to use improved seed and seed
 bought at an agro-input shop but more likely to use farmer-saved seed in
 accordance with our earlier definitions of adoption.
 Since the two opposing effects for farmer Types 3 and 6 partly cancel each
 other out, the dis-adoption effect is not pronounced in the entire sample.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To separate the two opposing effects, we restrict the sample to farmers
 that do not use complementary inputs at baseline in Column (3).
 We see that the estimated effects become stronger when we restrict attention
 to this subgroup.
 Farmers who were exposed to the treatment are almost eight percentage points
 less likely to adopt fresh seed of an improved variety.
 We see another particularly strong increase in the share of farmers that
 uses seed recycled from the previous harvest in the treatment group and
 a somewhat lower but still significant reduction in farmers who bought
 seed from an agro-input dealer.
 The treatment also has a significant and more pronounced negative effect
 on the adoption index for this subgroup of farmers that adopted at baseline.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Going one step further, in column (4) we restrict attention to the sample
 of farmers that do not use complementary inputs at baseline and also overestima
te the adoption premium (Type 3 farmers).
 According to Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "types of farmers"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we expect that especially these farmer types would accelerate disadoption
 in light of the new information.
 We find some support that these farmers indeed start using recycled seed.
 While we do not find that the effect for this group becomes stronger (perhaps
 due to small sample size), we do confirm predictions for the impact of
 the treatment on adoption for Type 1 and Type 5 farmers (not provided in
 tables to conserve space): The effect on adoption farmers that underestimate
 the adoption premium is insignificant (p=0.934 for the adoption index) as
 predicted in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "types of farmers"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

; the effect on adopting farmers that correctly estimate production is also
 insignificant as expected (p=0.998 for the adoption index).
 Taken together, these findings are consistent with the theory.

Finally, we investigate how the intervention affects the use of inputs (other
 than seed) and practices.
 Recall that for inputs and practices, the effect is expected to be positive,
 but only weakly so (see Prediction 4 in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We examine a range of cultivation practices and complementary inputs in
 line with what is featured in both treatment and control videos.
 The first outcome is an indicator for single–stand row planting.
 Row planting is an important management practice that can lead to significant
 yield gains.
 Under row planting, space is used optimally such that plants have sufficient
 nutrients, sunlight, and room to grow.
 However, row planting increases workload, meaning farmers often engage
 in broadcast planting, which is less demanding on their labor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reducing the seeding rate (i.e., the number of seeds sown) is the second outcome
 of interest.
 Farmers often plant more seed than necessary because they fear that it
 may not germinate.
 However, using more than two seeds per hill leads to stunted maize growth
 due to competition for light and nutrients.
 At the same time, just as for row planting, a lower seed rate may increase
 the workload, as farmers need to engage in gap filling after one week if
 seeds fail to germinate.

The next three outcomes relate to fertilizer use.
 The application of organic fertilizer is important for soil structure,
 while inorganic fertilizers such as di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) or nitrogen,
 phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) and urea (nitrogen) are used to provide
 essential nutrients at particular points in time.
 The cost of organic fertilizer is mainly in terms of labor, whereas both
 DAP and urea need to be bought from an agro-input shop and applied during
 planting (DAP) and at early stages of growth (urea).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Farmers should weed within the first week after planting and as often as
 possible.
 Official recommendations are to weed at least three times per seasons.
 Furthermore, invasive insects such as the fall armyworm (
\emph on
Spodoptera frugiperda
\emph default
) or maize stalk borer (
\emph on
Busseola fusca
\emph default
) can severely reduce yields.
 Pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides are widely available
 in agro-input shops under commercial names such as Rocket, Lalafos and
 Dudu acelamectin.
 While weeding requires labor, pesticides come at a pecuniary cost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we look at differences in re-sowing or gap-filling.
 This involves revisiting the plot after planting and inspecting the hills
 for seed germination.
 If a seed does not germinate, a new seed is planted in that location.
 Re-sowing, reduced seed rate, and row-planting are thus likely to be correlated.
 We also combine all outcomes in an overall index following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 and show no impact of the intervention on the use of inputs and practices.
 As in previous tables, Columns (1) reports means for outcomes before the
 treatment.
 Column (2) shows that farmers do not invest more effort in response to
 the intervention.
 On the contrary (and especially if we only consider the subset of farmers
 that adopted at baseline, see Column (3)), farmers appear to be less likely
 to plant in rows.
 The negative effect on some practices may be due to the fact that farmers
 may adopt some complementary inputs or practices, but in insufficient quantitie
s and/or suboptimal combinations for the adoption premium to realize.
 When farmers subsequently dis-adopt, they may also stop using these inputs
 or practices, leading to a negative expected effect on practices for Type
 3 farmers in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "types of farmers"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 In particular, for the case of row planting, it may be that farmers that
 adopt at baseline simply follow planting instructions that are typically
 printed on the seed bags.
 However, only row-planting without additional inputs such as fertilizer
 or pesticide use may not lead to expected yields, and disappointed farmers
 may dis-adopt in the next season which case they may also revert to plating
 methods used before adoption.
 Finally, when we isolate the effect on Type 3 farmers, we find no significant
 effect on the index.

 We also measure harvest-related outcomes (production and yield) on a randomly

 The three outcomes are also combined in an index following

Column (2) shows that, in line with our prediction, a significantly higher
 share of farmers in the treatment group state that they produced what they
 expected.
 The effect is larger for the subset of farmers that adopted at baseline,
 see Column (3).
 If we focus on (Type 3) farmers that adopted but also held inflated expectation
s, the positive effect becomes insignificant (Column 4).
 For Type 5 farmers the effect size is somewhat larger than for type 3 farmers,
 but still insignificant (p-value 0.188).
 In line with predictions, the effect on expectation is insignificant for
 farmers that have correct expectations (p-value 0.973).
 Again, taken together, this suggests that a subset of farmers indeed started
 out with inflated expectations, which were

\begin_layout Standard
This paper was motivated by the observation that farmers often seem to be
 unaware that many agricultural technologies such as improved seed varieties
 require substantial complementary inputs, better management practices,
 and greater effort for their benefits to realize.
 In a sense, farmers thus overestimate the returns to a technology and are
 disappointed when they compare expectations to realized yields.
 As learning about a new technology is hard, farmers may attribute the disappoin
ting results to the technology itself and dis-adopt in the next season.
 This is consistent with findings suggesting that farmers blame poor returns
 on inputs they believe to be counterfeit or of low quality even when objective
 quality assessments show otherwise

\begin_layout Standard
To test the hypothesis that farmers think of improved varieties as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

miracle seed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, we conducted a field experiment built around a short, engaging video on
 recommended input use and management practices for maize cultivation in
 eastern Uganda.
 More in particular, we produced two versions of the video that differ only
 in terms of the presence of explicit messaging about the importance of
 using complementary inputs such as fertilizer and practices such as weeding
 when using improved seed.
 Screenings of the two versions were randomly assigned to villages in our
 study area, and then to maize farmers in those villages, resulting in a
 sample of almost 3,500 farmers who were interviewed at regular intervals
 to uncover any changes in their knowledge about best practices in maize
 cultivation as well as their seed or variety choices, their expectations
 of yield and output, and their use of complementary inputs and management
 practices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we do not find treatment effects that differ significantly from zero
 for knowledge outcomes for the entire sample, we do observe that all coefficien
ts move in the expected direction and suspect that the lack of statistical
 significance may be caused by low power given an already high level of
 knowledge among our sampled farmers.
 We do find, consistent with our theory, that the intervention significantly
 improved knowledge for farmers that adopted at baseline, since for this
 subset of farmers the information is likely to be most useful.
 Further reducing the sample to farmers that adopt at baseline and also
 overestimate the adoption premium increases the treatment effect on one
 knowledge outcome, but the smaller sample also means the overall knowledge
 effect becomes insignificant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the main outcome of interest—behavior related to seed choices—we find
 that treated farmers were less likely to use improved varieties, and generally
 more likely to dis-adopt.
 Also here, this effect is replicated for farmers that adopt at baseline
 and overestimate the adoption premium (but increasingly smaller sample
 sizes make parameter estimates less precise).
 Also in line with the theory, we find no effect on adoption if we single
 out farmers that adopt at baseline and correctly predict future production,
 nor do we find an effect for farmers that adopt at baseline and underestimate
 the adoption premium.
 We also find that farmers that received the treatment were more likely
 to report that their harvest was in line with what they expected.
 No effects were found for use of complementary inputs and practices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The treatment effect on adoption could imply that treated farmers dis-adopt
 permanently if the video makes the hidden price of adopting more salient
 to them and reduces their expected profits.
 Alternatively, the observed dis-adoption could be dis-adoption that would
 have happened anyway if the video reduces a bias and accelerates a learning
 process towards more realistic expectations.
 In the latter case, the effect is likely to be short-lived and there will
 be lower dis-adoption in subsequent seasons for two reasons.
 Firstly, if the treatment only accelerated dis-adoption that would have
 happened anyway, part of this dis-adoption process will have now also started
 in the control group: a share of control farmers with biased expectations
 that initially adopted will have experienced a disappointing harvest, adjusted
 their expectations, and dis-adopted.
 Secondly, a share of treated farmers that initially dis-adopted will re-adopt:
 information about complementarities and changes in perceptions may reduce
 their risk premia, particularly in the longer run.
 In this scenario, farmers try improved seed with complementary inputs and
 learn that outcomes are consistently in line with expectations.
 They may experience that combining improved technologies with complementary
 inputs is consistently more profitable.
 And even if margins are lower, they may trade off the reduction in risk
 with increased investment.
 This is in line with what we find looking at data from subsequent seasons:
 when we revisit the farmers after one additional agricultural season, we
 no longer find any differences between treatment and control groups.

 At least some treated farmers who had dis-adopted in response to new informatio
n and more realistic expectations are, in fact, cultivating the new variety
 again; these may now be in for the long run.
 This indicates that the video did not increase dis-adoption per se; it
 only accelerated dis-adoption that was going to happen at some point.

 Statistics, In Press: "In a recently published paper, [bulte_freeseed]

 technologies if they do not work sufficiently on their plots, and that
 this behavioral response may lead to dis-adoption.
 However, our results differ from this and other studies that find that
 improved technologies increase agricultural productivity by crowding in

 do discuss the possibility that their effects are driven by an income effect.
 However, in the presence of an income effect, they understand the effect
 of the additional income resulting from the adoption of the technology
 (a flood-tolerant rice variety).
 The income effect we are concerned about is one that results from farmers
 receiving seed for free, potentially freeing up money for other investments.
\end_layout

 In our experiment, no free seed was provided, so when adoption decisions
 were made, farmers had to take the combined cost of seed

 cost of complementary inputs into account, further eroding the expected
 profitability of the improved technology.

\begin_layout Standard
Our findings have implications for the study of technology adoption dynamics.
 If disappointment about the performance of a technology is erroneously
 attributed to the technology itself amd this learning failure is not corrected—
for instance, by pointing out that the seed is good; the problem is with
 complementary input use—farmers move into a potentially long periods of
 consistent under-adoption even if it is profitable for them.

Note that new varieties are introduced now and then and extension workers
 and successful neighbors may convince farmers to try again.
 So farmers are likely to adopt again after some seasons, but generally
 only the be disappointed again.

 Furthermore, as negative experiences tend to stick more and negative news
 may travel faster, exaggerated expectations and subsequent dis-adoption
 may further complicating (social) learning

Our study also casts some doubt on the suggestion that Bayesian learning
 via sequential adoption can be a successful strategy for smallholder farmers
 in the long run

 If there are important interaction effects between technologies, inputs
 and practices, it seems unreasonable to assume that farmers can try out
 all possible combinations of inputs to learn about these interactions in
 a Bayesian fashion, at least within a reasonable time frame.
 This suggests their is an important role for agricultural extension and
 advisory services when introducing new technologies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our findings also have implications for how public and private actors in
 the agriculture sector should promote new technologies.
 If smallholders' information sources such as private input dealers and
 public extension agents are not sufficiently able to communicate the importance
 of complementary inputs and practices, then lower likelihoods of sustained
 adoption may result.
 Worse, if smallholders have incorrect perceptions about poor quality caused
 by misattribution, the persistence of these perceptions may crowd out the
 market for quality inputs

 And while the distribution of free or subsidized technologies and inputs
 may go some way in encouraging farmers' learning processes and

 their perceptions (for example, with unique standalone technologies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

), this approach can break down when complementary inputs and practices
 are not part of the package, which may again lead to disappointment among
 farmers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our findings further suggest that agricultural development programs, extension
 providers, and agri-input companies need to focus less on marketing single

 technologies for smallholders, and more on the design and communication
 of comprehensive packages that include both agronomic and economic information
 on topics such as expected variation in yield and output, sensitivity of
 timing for specific farming tasks, magnitude and costs of family and hired
 labor, and the relative drudgery of effort, among many others.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Another argument in favor of promoting packages instead of single technologies
 is provided by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

 who find that the promotion of modern seed varieties led to farmers increasingl
y deforesting primary forest to satisfy their higher demand for soil nutrients
 and nitrogen.
 We conclude that the design and communication of comprehensive packages
 requires greater investment in the form and content of rural education,
 extension and advisory services, and agri-input marketing strategies.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, while we find some evidence to support our theory, we do feel that
 more research is needed.
 For instance, it is unclear whether the small effects on knowledge are
 due to farmers already knowing about the importance of complementary input
 use, or due to a poor choices of questions to measure knowledge.
 If farmers indeed do not lack knowledge, the fact that we do find significant
 effects on seed use suggest behavioral barriers to adoption, such as inertia
 or procrastination, and alternative interventions may be even more effective.
 Future studies may consider an improved experimental design, for instance
 by blocking on farmer type instead of simply calculating conditional means
 ex-post, and a more appropriate questionnaire that also attempts to capture
 behavioral impact pathways.
