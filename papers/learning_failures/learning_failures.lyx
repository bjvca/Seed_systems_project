Miracle seeds: Biased expectations, complementary input use, and the dynamics
 of smallholder technology adoption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
To fully benefit from new agricultural technologies like improved seed varieties
, significant investment in complementary inputs such as fertilizers and
 pesticides, and practices such as systematic planting, irrigation, and
 weeding are also required.
 Farmers may fail to recognize the importance of these complements, leading
 to disappointing crop yields and outputs and, eventually, dis-adoption
 of the improved variety.
 Using a field experiment, we test an information intervention among smallholder
 maize farmers in eastern Uganda that points out these complimentarities
 and find that this leads to lower adoption in the treatment group.
 We rationalize this finding with a simple model of resource constrained
 farmers having misspecified mental models of the technology production
 function.
 Consistent with the theoretical model, adoption to be lower in among resource
 constrained farmers in the treatment group.

To feed a growing population in an environmentally sustainable manner and
 in the midst of a long-term climate crisis, farmers throughout the developing
 world are expected to grow more food on less land with greater efficiency

 To achieve this goal, much is expected from new technologies, especially
 from higher-yielding varieties that are resilient to pests, diseases, and
 other biotic stresses and are tolerant of droughts, floods, heat, and other
 abiotic stresses

Unfortunately, the adoption of such technologies is lagging in areas where
 they may have the biggest impact.
 Recent trends in agricultural productivity growth in Africa show that technolog
ical progress has largely stagnated on the continent

 However, significant heterogeneity underlies this general stagnation.
 For instance, at the micro level, we often observe dis-adoption patterns
 and trends, where farmers choose to switch back to technologies and inputs
 they have been using for decades after trying out a new technology once
 or twice

 We use the term

 technologies—and that each figures differently into our understanding of
 the conventional agricultural production function.

There are many reasons why farmers may not move into a state of sustained
 adoption of a given technology.
 For neoclassical explanations such as credit constraints or risk aversion,
 the reader is referred to the excellent reviews by

 In this paper, we take a more behavioral economics approach and consider
 the possibility that farmers hold inflated expectations of new technologies
 as an explanation for their dis-adoption.
 These inflated expectations result from the possibility that farmers may
 be unaware, fail to recognize, or downplay the importance of the need for
 substantial complementary investment.
 Indeed, for the new hybrid seeds suitable for East African maize farmers
 that came on the market a few decades ago, the promise to double or even
 triple yields could typically only be achieved in favorable climatic conditions
 and with the addition of fertilizer and other inputs

 show that farming with improved maize varieties is far more costly than
 farming with unimproved maize varieties.
 The additional production costs include not just the (higher) cost of seed
 but also higher fertilizer costs required to achieve expected yield improvement
s, as well as higher costs of labor for farm tasks that are associated with
 the cultivation of higher-yielding maize.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The impact of inflated expectations due to insufficient complementary input
 use on future adoption behavior is complex and depends on what the disappointed
 outcome is attributed to, and hence the learning that takes place.
 It is well known that learning about a new technology is hard: As multiple
 factors simultaneously affect yields and outputs, learning about the causal
 impact of a new technology from a single experience is difficult, especially
 if the technology performs only under specific or stochastic circumstances
 such as abiotic stress 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "LybbertBell2010"

\end_inset

, or if the farmer is unable to learn in a Bayesian manner because it is
 too cognitively taxing 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gars2019can"

\end_inset

, pays attention to the wrong attributes of the technology 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, or is unable to sufficiently complement own experience with social learning
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "foster1995learning,10.1257/aer.100.1.35"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Inflated expectations are likely to have a negative impact on future adoption
 if farmers attribute the disappointing outcomes to the seed itself.
 However, as there are different types of seed and quality of seed is know
 to vary, farmers may be tempted to try again at some point in the future,
 particularly if neighbors get better results and extension workers are
 promoting improved seed varieties.
 Alternatively, farmers may attribute the disappointing outcome to other
 factors such as weather events, in which case they are likely to adopt
 again in the future.
 Finally, if farmers attribute disappointing outcomes to the correct cause
 (insufficient complementary investment), farmers may re-optimize in light
 of the additional cost of complementary inputs and practices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many researchers working in developing-country agriculture will have their
 own anecdotal evidence of inflated expectations that illustrate the presence
 of biased expectations, sub-optimal complementary investments, and subsequent
 (temporary) dis-adoption when disappointing outcomes are attributed to
 the technology itself.
 For instance, researchers may be familiar with farmers' belief that using
 inorganic fertilizer for one cropping cycle will lead to long-lasting soil
 fertility improvements.
 Others may be familiar with another common belief among farmers—often promoted
 by extension agents and agro-dealers—that an improved variety is a

 Specifically, we show all farmers in our sample a short, engaging video
 about the use of improved inputs and recommended management practices for
 maize cultivation.
 In the treatment group, we show the same video, except that in certain
 points in the narration—for instance when the use of inorganic fertilizers
 is demonstrated or when weeding is explained—we highlight the particular
 importance of using additional inputs and performing certain management
 practices in conjunction with the improved variety, and manage expectations
 by stressing that farmers should not skimp on this input or practice because
 improved seed varieties are not

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first check whether farmers are able to extract the relevant information
 from the treatment video and find that farmers in the treatment group are
 better in selecting the correct answer in a quiz on the use of complementary
 investments.
 Turning to adoption behavior, we find that farmers in the treatment group
 are less likely to adopt improved seed varieties than control group farmers.
 We find no evidence that the intervention affected the use of complementary
 inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides, or recommended practices for
 maize management such as weeding frequency and re-planting.
 We do see that among treated farmers, expectations tend to be more in line
 with realized output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To explain the negative impact of our information treatment on adoption,
 we develop a simple model of technology adoption.
 In this model, resource constrained farmers compare the expected returns
 of an improved technology to their business-as-usual choices.
 The new technology comes at a cost, while the unimproved technology does
 not.
 Both technologies, though, require complementary inputs and efforts that
 directly affect productivity, with productivity gains from the new technology—t
he adoption premium—only materializing when complementary inputs and practices
 exceed business-as-usual levels for the unimproved technology.
 Further, recognizing that farmers may be heterogeneous, we define several
 farmer types and derive predictions about how they might behave if they
 learn about the true shape of the production function of the new technology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These findings have implications for our understanding of smallholder technology
 adoption dynamics.
 If farmers do not use appropriate complementary inputs and practices when
 using improved maize varieties because they believe in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

, their yields are likely to be disappointing.
 Often, disappointment about the performance of a technology is then erroneously
 attributed to the technology itself, potentially leading to dis-adoption.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Correcting
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 incorrect beliefs about the needed inputs and efforts may accelerate dis-adopti
on for these farmers.
 However, if farmers' expectations become more realistic, the ones that
 keep adopting (or start adopting in light of the new information) will
 be less likely to be disappointed in the future, leading to sustained adoption,
 which in turn could lead to efficiency gains and positive spillover effects.
 Our findings also have policy implications: public and private actors in
 the agriculture sector need to promote new technologies as highly site-
 and context-specific combinations of technologies, inputs, practices, and
 efforts instead of single

Agricultural technology adoption is at the heart of a rich body of research
 on food security, poverty reduction, economic development, and structural
 transformation.
 Studies on the economics of technical change in agriculture go back to
 at least 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and are reviewed in widely cited articles such as

 More recently and with the proliferation of field experiments and randomized
 controlled trials, economic theories that explore alternative drivers of
 technology adoption have received greater empirical attention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of these studies (implicitly) assume that some kind of graduation model
 underlies the technical change process, wherein farmers switch from a low-level
 equilibrium to a high-level equilibrium in which technology use is sustained
 once initial conditions—typically, access to information or finance—are
 satisfied or binding constraints removed

 Yet most of these studies follow farmers across a limited number of agricultura
l seasons, and are unable to fully appreciate the dynamics of technology
 adoption over time.
 Only a few studies offer a longer-term perspective, documenting significant
 levels of dis-adoption

 is a model of learning failures where farmers have inflated expectations
 about the returns to a new technology, but fail to uncover the true form
 of the production function through experience, leading to disappointment
 and subsequent dis-adoption.
 Indeed, heterogeneity in farmer characteristics implies that farmers need
 to learn whether using a new technology is optimal for their specific context

One strand of the literature argues that sequential adoption leads to experienti
al learning by farmers.
 In cases where technologies are bundled in packages, it is often observed
 that farmers sequentially adopt components of the package, rather than
 adopting the entire package at once

 argue that this occurs when farmers employ a Bayesian approach to learning
 in which they try to isolate the impact of one component of the package
 at a time.
 However, there are circumstances under which this strategy is not optimal
 because it can prevent farmers from identifying potential synergies between
 technologies, inputs, and practices.
 Indeed, the reason why many interventions are presented as a package is
 because these interaction effects are not trivial.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 find that banana tissue culture, a technology to ensure that banana plantlets
 are free from pests and diseases, leads to a seven percent yield gain in
 Kenya.
 However, they also find that improving access to irrigation can lift yield
 gains above 20 percent.
 If many complementarities like this exist, it seems unlikely that farmers
 are in a position to follow a sequential learning path that allows for
 all possible interactions between the different technologies within a reasonabl
e time frame.
 Furthermore, as mentioned above, farmers may face certain behavioral constraint
s that inhibit their ability to learn about interaction effects if, for
 example, they pay attention to minor or tangential attributes of the package
 and miss the more important attributes

 Our study contributes to this literature by providing additional evidence
 on the limits of Bayesian learning in the context of agricultural technology
 adoption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another strand of the literature addresses the technology learning process
 in terms of how farmers compare realized yields against expected yields
 to inform their subsequent adoption decisions.
 The effect of incorrect expectations about future returns on decision-making
 has been studied most in the context of investments in education, but is
 readily applicable to technology adoption in agriculture.
 For example, both

 finds that a video intervention that informs Ugandan farmers about the
 returns on intensification investments in rice growing improved practices
 and increased input use and production.
 Note that across these studies, it is assumed that the individual underestimate
s the returns in question.
 In our study, as farmers fail to appreciate the importance of complementary
 inputs, farmers are in a sense overestimating returns to a new technology,
 leading to over-investment in technologies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the intervention we use to test our hypothesis builds on a strand
 of the literature that focuses on the role of video-mediated messaging
 to convey salient information to farmers.
 This literature explores the ways in which informational videos can change

\begin_layout Standard
In the present study we use a video that promotes best practices in maize
 growing using improved seed varieties.
 In the video that was shown to the treatment group, we particularly stress
 the importance of complementary inputs and efforts to get the most out
 of improved seed varieties.
 To isolate the effect of the form just being exposed to the video, we also
 show a video that promotes best practices in maize growing using improved
 seed varieties to the control group.
 However, in the control group version of the video, we do not point out
 the importance of complementary inputs and efforts.
 Our study contributes to this literature by testing if videos are also
 effective in conveying subtle messages.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model predictions were tested using a field experiment conducted with
 almost 3,500 maize farmers in eastern Uganda.
 The intervention consisted of screening short, engaging videos about best
 practices in maize cultivation.
 The videos were shown individually to participating farmers on tablet computers
 by specially trained field enumerators.
 The content of the video scripts was developed following extensive interviews
 with experts, including agricultural extension agents, plant breeders,
 seed producers, government officials, and farmers themselves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The video opens with a woman and a man standing in a well-kept maize plot
 inspecting their crop.
 The couple explains that they have been farmers for more than ten years
 but that their fields have not always been productive.
 They recount how they used to struggle to feed their children, but that
 over time, they learned how to grow more maize on less land.
 The secret of their success, the couple continues, lies in the adoption
 of improved technologies and best practices, such as the use of organic
 fertilizer, optimal plant spacing, and reduced seed rates.
 Furthermore, they explain that especially the use of improved seed varieties
 such as hybrid seed or OPVs contributed significantly to increased production.
 They conclude this introduction by stating that they are proud to be successful
 farmers who can feed their families and even produce surpluses that they
 can sell in the market.
 The viewer is then invited to become equally successful in farming by paying
 close attention as the featured (role model) farmers explain in detail
 the most important technologies, inputs, and practices that transformed
 their lives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experiment was implemented in the form of two variations of this interventio
n video.
 The control group viewed the video as described above: The control video
 shows different recommended inputs and practices like row planting and
 inorganic fertilizer application but does not comment on the importance
 of combining improved seed varieties with all the other inputs and practices.
 The treatment group viewed a similar video, but now for each individual
 recommended input or practice it is made explicit that significant complementar
ities exist between improved varieties and recommended inputs and practices.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For example, in the control video, the farmer explains that: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

At planting time, I paid attention to recommended spacing, carefully measuring
 1 foot between plants and 2.5 feet between rows.
 I first dug a 4-inch deep hole and added 1 water bottle cap of Di-Ammonium
 Phosphate (DAP).
 Then I added some soil.
 Afterwards, I put 1 maize seed in and covered it with soil.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 In the treatment video, the farmer narrates the same scene but adds a pointed
 comment at the end of the exposition, stating: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did you know that recommended spacing and using DAP is even more important
 when using improved seeds?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Often, we also added a few sentences that aim to correct inflated expectations.
 For instance, when discussing the use of inorganic fertilizer, we warn
 the viewer that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Improved seed are not miracle seed! They also need proper fertilizer application
 to get the higher yields.” For the practice of gap filling two weeks after
 planting, we warn: “Do not assume that just because you used an improved
 seed variety, all seeds will germinate!”

By randomizing which video is viewed by our sampled farmers, we can isolate
 the causal effect of making salient that improved varieties do not substitute
 for inputs and effort, but in fact require more investment.
 The use of a control video has an additional advantage: since it is not
 clear to farmers or enumerators which video is the treatment and which
 is the control, we reduce the likelihood that results are driven by experimente
r demand effects

 Furthermore, to reduce the likelihood that treated households could provide

—randomization was conducted at the village level in a manner that ensured
 reasonable geographic and social distance between villages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experiment targeted the second agricultural season of 2021, where maize
 is planted in August and September and harvested in November and December.
 We implemented the treatment in April 2021, well before the start of the
 season, to ensure that farmers had the necessary information before making
 decisions on seed and input use.
 At this point in time, we also collected baseline data on our sample households.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The intervention was repeated just before planting in August 2021, and post-trea
tment data was collected in January and February 2022.
 The intervention was again repeated in the first season of 2022, with a
 final round of data collection conducted in July and August 2022.
 Note that this paper focuses on outcomes following the 2021 agricultural
 season since we do not expect significant results from continuing the intervent
ion (i.e., providing farmers with the same information) in 2022.
 However, we do explore descriptive results from 2022 to provide insight
 into patterns of sustained adoption among treated farmers.

\begin_layout Standard
The field experiment was conducted in southeastern Uganda, an area known
 for its maize production by smallholder farmers where maize is considered
 both a food and cash crop.
 Because it was conducted as part of a larger study on maize seed supply
 chains, farmers were drawn from the catchment areas (market-sheds) of agro-inpu
t shops.
 These shops sell agricultural inputs and technologies in countries with
 large smallholder farmer populations living in remote areas with relatively
 poor infrastructure.
 A reasonably dense network of semi-formal agro-input dealers provides access
 to seed, fertilizer, agro-chemicals, and tools, and sometimes agricultural
 advisory service and credit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sampling frame was developed as follows: first, we listed all agro-input
 shops in 11 districts in southeastern Uganda, resulting in the identification
 of 347 agro-input dealers.
 We then asked these dealers to identify the villages where most of their
 customers come from.
 This sampling frame allows us to assume that sampled farmers have both
 reasonable and similar access to improved maize varieties if they choose
 to adopt as a result of our intervention, and that other constraining factors
 such as seed quality, credit access, or individual preferences were similarly
 distributed across our treatment and control groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, field supervisors compiled household lists for each village and randomly
 sampled ten maize-cultivating households per village using systematic sampling
 (nth name selection technique).
 The enumerators interviewed 3,470 farmers using a household survey instrument
 that contained a wide range of questions about the individual, their household,
 and their farm.
 From an initial sample of 3,470 farmers who were interviewed in the baseline
 survey round, only 63 farmers dropped out in the subsequent survey round.
 We did not find that attrition differed significantly between treatment
 and control group, and thus proceed with the analysis on a balanced panel
 of 3,407 farmers.

Adoption

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this sub-section, we explore the dynamics of improved variety adoption
 by smallholder farmers in our study area.
 We define adoption of improved maize varieties as follows.
 First, we asked farmers on how many plots they cultivated maize during
 the preceding season.
 From these plots, we randomly selected one plot and asked detailed questions
 about seed and varietal use, input use, and management practices.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The decision to ask detailed questions on only one (randomly selected) plot
 as opposed to asking details on all plots was made because there is generally
 high correlation between technology use, input use and management practices
 within a household.
 As such, we decided to increase the number of farmers at the expense of
 the number of plots as this would increase statistical power.
 That said, one may be worried that farmers use different seed on different
 plots, and if the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wrong
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 plot is chosen, a farmer that is actually an adopting farmer is categorized
 as a non-adopter.
 We investigated this issue further by using a different variable for adoption
 status, namely if the farmer used seed of an improved variety on any field,
 and results were very similar.
 Furthermore, selection of the plot happens only during baseline; at other
 surveys reference is made to the name of the plot that was randomly selected
 during baseline.
 Provided that farmers plant the same seed type on the same plot every season,
 this would also mean that adoption dynamics are not affected by the random
 selection process.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Based on the information collected, we then defined a farmer as an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Adopter
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if they used either non-recycled (newly purchased, not saved) seed of (a)
 a hybrid or (b) an open pollinated variety.
 All others were defined as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Non-adopters.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We acknowledge that this definition of adoption is not perfect.
 Seed of an open pollinated variety that has been recycled (saved) up to
 four times could still be considered as improved, and farmers using this
 seed could still be counted as adopters.
 However, we expect the problem of incorrect beliefs about 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

miracle seeds
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and biased expectations to be most pronounced when smallholders do not
 have experience with the seed.
 If farmers recycle and use seed several times, their beliefs about the
 relationship between efforts and the returns to improved varieties will
 become closer to reality as they learn from season to season.
 That is why this stricter definition is useful to answer the questions
 raised in this paper.
 Also, most of our results remain robust to different definitions of adoption.

 illustrates the evolution of varietal adoption among farmers over different
 survey rounds using this definition.
 We see that the share of adopters slowly increases over time: at Survey
 1 (baseline), about 43 percent of farmers report to have sown an improved
 maize variety on the randomly selected plot.
 At the end of the first season, at the time of Survey 2 in January 2022,
 this figure increased to about 49 percent and, by Survey 3 in July and
 August 2022, to about 52 percent.

Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 also illustrates the dynamics of adoption in our sample.
 At the top, we see a substantial share of households (19 percent) that
 adopted in all three survey rounds.
 These could be considered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Always Adopters
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or Type 1 and Type 5 farmers, as described earlier.
 At the bottom of the chart, we find an equally substantial share (22 percent)
 that can similarly be categorized as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Never Adopters
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or Type 2 and Type 4 farmers.
 However, we also see that a large group of farmers that adopts during Survey
 1 reverts to farmer-saved seed at the time of the second survey (13 percent)
 or still adopts at the time of Survey 2 but eventually dis-adopts at the
 time of Survey 3 (6 percent).
 During this same period, large numbers of households also start adopting.
 We see that 19 percent of non-adopting households adopt at the time of
 Survey 2 and 10 percent of households do not adopt in both Surveys 1 and
 2 but do adopt by Survey 3.
 Finally, we find that the some households seem to be moving in and out
 of adoption (7 percent) or moving out and back into adoption (6 percent).

Another indication of the dynamic nature of adoption is the fact that a

 seemed to be disappointed.

 one in four indicated that they will not use the seed again in the future.

 The weights are derived from the (inverse) covariance matrix, such that

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We test farmer knowledge by means of a short quiz where a number of questions
 were asked and enumerators read a set of alternative answers to farmers
 who then selected the response that they felt most appropriate.
 The quiz begins with a general question asking farmers whether they think
 recommended cultivation practices like weeding and fertilizer application
 are less, equally, or more important when using improved varieties.
 This is followed by a more specific multiple-choice question on a particular
 practice—weeding—when cultivating an improved variety.
 Response options are: (1) you do not need to weed and remove Striga because
 seed of improved varieties is treated to resist weed infestation; (2) you
 do not need to weed and remove Striga in the first four weeks because seed
 of improved varieties is better at competing for sun, nutrients, and water
 than normal seed; and (3) you need to weed and remove Striga just as you
 would with unimproved varieties because maize seed does not compete well
 for sunlight, water, and nutrients.
 The quiz contains a similar question about a key input as well—fertilizer—when
 cultivating an improved variety.
 The options here are: (1) you do not need to use inorganic fertilizer because
 you already purchased seed; (2) you can use less fertilizer than you normally
 would since seed of an improved maize variety grows faster; (3) you need
 to use the amount of fertilizer that you would with unimproved varieties
 because also seed of an improved variety needs nutrition; and (4) you should
 use more fertilizer than you would normally use.
 The three outcomes are then combined in an index following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1198/016214508000000841"

 to assess impact on general knowledge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The figure shows a positive and significant effect of the treatment on knowledge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second key outcome is adoption.
 Also here, we expect a positive outcome.
 We use four related or even partly overlapping outcomes to capture the
 adoption of seed of an imporved variety.
 First, we asked farmers which maize variety they planted on the randomly
 selected maize plot in the season prior to the survey (but after the interventi
on).
 We define adoption as described in Sub-section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Adoption"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 (and visualized in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Dynamics-of-seed"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 A second related outcome we consider is the use of recycled seed, which
 is defined as seed that a farmer has saved themselves or obtained from
 another farmer who saved it (for example, a neighbor or relative).
 Another third related outcome is the share of farmers that report having
 purchased seed from an agro-input shop.
 The three outcomes are also combined in an index following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1198/016214508000000841"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, with the second outcome entering in a negative way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third key outcome we compare between treatment and control households
 measures complementary input use.
 Also here, we expect that our intervention increases the use of complementary
 inputs such as organic and inorganic fertilizers (such as di-ammonium phosphate
 (DAP), nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) and urea (nitrogen)) and
 the use of pesticides.
 In addition to the use of inputs, we also include in the index some labour
 intensive agronomic practices that farmers may view as substitutes for
 good seed such as weeding frequency, weeding timing and re-sowing.

 either of a Variety H, a new variety that is stochastically dominant in

 In doing so, they compare the expected profit functions of Variety H 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{it}^{*^{H}}$

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In a country like Uganda, where most grain is aggregated, milled, and sold
 without varietal denomination, this is a reasonable assumption.
 In other countries such as Malawi or Mexico, where consumers have distinct
 varietal preferences related to taste, texture, and color, this assumption
 might not always hold.

\begin_inset Formula $E\left(Y_{it+1}^{L}\right)$

 Seed of Variety L is assumed to be free, while for seed of Variety H, 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{it}$

 is procured at a cost 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{t}>0$

 takes this into account but also notes that the cost of, in her case, farmer-sa
ved seed is likely to be low, if not zero.
 Rather than complicating the model by explicitly modeling the price of
 the stochastically inferior variety, we decide to set it to zero.
 Setting it to a small positive value would not change the predictions derived
 from the model.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In both profit functions, the cost of a range of complementary inputs and
 management practices, referred to as inputs, are deducted and summarized
 by the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{it}$
\end_inset

 with corresponding factor prices 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{t}$
\end_inset

 We also assume that the farmer faces a fixed budget at the time input decisions
 have to be made, that is 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{t}s_{it}+\sum w_{t}X_{it}^{H}+\sum w_{t}X_{it}^{L}\leq\bar{B}$

Farmers adopt the stochastically dominant Variety H if they expect it to

For simplicity, we assume that farmers have only one plot and model the

Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 shows that adoption decisions fundamentally depend on yield comparisons.
 We assume that yield for Variety L is a function of inputs used:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Y_{it+1}^{L}=Y_{it}\left(X_{it}^{L}\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and that this relationship is assumed to be positive with decreasing returns
 to scale: 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dY_{it}}{dX_{it}}>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{d^{2}Y_{it}}{dX_{it}^{2}}<0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yield for Variety H follows the same function, but adds a positive and constant
 adoption premium 
\begin_inset Formula $(A>0)$
\end_inset

.
 However, the adoption premium only applies when the farmer uses at least
 the same amount of complementary inputs as they would when using Variety
 L 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(X_{it}^{H}\geq X_{it}^{L}\right)$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Y_{it+1}^{H}=A\left(X_{it}^{H}\geq X_{it}^{L}\right)+Y_{it}\left(X_{it}^{H}\right)\label{eq:truerel}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If farmers are able to predict yields—at least on average—in 
\emph on
t+1
\emph default
, such that 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(Y_{it+1}\right)=Y_{it+1}+\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon\sim N(0,\sigma)$
\end_inset

, their decision to adopt would depend on the difference in yield between
 Variety H and L, on the relative prices of inputs, and on the yield responses
 to the inputs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we introduce farmer heterogeneity into the model by assuming that
 at least some farmers are not aware of the true relationship between 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{it}^{H}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{it}$
\end_inset

, but instead believe that the adoption premium is always present, that
 is, 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(Y_{it+1}^{H}\right)=A+Y_{it}\left(X_{it}^{H}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 As a result, some farmer will use Variety H but not enough complementary
 inputs, leading to disappointing outcomes.

Impact on adoption

name "impact adoption"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start with the main hypothesis of this paper: whether farmers who were
 pointed out that improved varieties need substantial investment in complementar
y inputs and management practices behave differently in terms of seed use
 in subsequent seasons than farmers that were not similarly informed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results are summarized in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Treatment-effects"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Column (1) shows sample means of the four outcomes at baseline with standard
 deviations in the brackets below.
 We find that 44 percent of farmers use fresh seed of improved varieties
 and that one third of farmers reports that the seed that they planted on
 the randomly selected plot was obtained from an agro-input dealer.
 Column (2) shows the difference between treatment and control groups for
 outcomes after the intervention.
 Our theory suggests that in response to being sensitized about the importance
 of using complementary inputs and management practices when using an improved
 variety, some farmers (Types 3 and 6) will change their adoption behavior
 (Prediction 2 in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Theoretical-framework"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 A relatively large share of farmers that initially overestimated the probabilit
y of an adoption premium (Type 3) will dis-adopt as their expected marginal
 return is reduced by the treatment.
 A share of farmers that initially underestimated the returns to improved
 varieties (Type 6) may start adopting as their expected marginal return
 is increased by the treatment.
 We find that adoption, as measured by the index, significantly decreases
 for the entire sample.
 Furthermore, all coefficients move in the direction of dis-adoption.
 This implies that farmers are less likely to use improved seed and seed
 bought at an agro-input shop but more likely to use farmer-saved seed in
 accordance with our earlier definitions of adoption.
 Since the two opposing effects for farmer Types 3 and 6 partly cancel each
 other out, the dis-adoption effect is not pronounced in the entire sample.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To separate the two opposing effects, we restrict the sample to farmers
 that adopted at baseline in Column (3).
 We see that the estimated effects become stronger when we restrict attention
 to this subgroup (and exclude Type 6 farmers from the analysis).
 Farmers who were exposed to the treatment are almost eight percentage points
 less likely to adopt fresh seed of an improved variety.
 We see another particularly strong increase in the share of farmers that
 uses seed recycled from the previous harvest in the treatment group and
 a somewhat lower but still significant reduction in farmers who bought
 seed from an agro-input dealer.
 The treatment also has a significant and more pronounced negative effect
 on the adoption index for this subgroup of farmers that adopted at baseline.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Going one step further, in column (4) we restrict attention to the sample
 of farmers that adopt at baseline and also overestimate the adoption premium
 (Type 3 farmers).
 According to Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "types of farmers"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we expect that especially these farmer types would accelerate disadoption
 in light of the new information.
 We find some support that these farmers indeed start using recycled seed.
 While we do not find that the effect for this group becomes stronger (perhaps
 due to small sample size), we do confirm predictions for the impact of
 the treatment on adoption for Type 1 and Type 5 farmers (not provided in
 tables to conserve space): The effect on adoption farmers that underestimate
 the adoption premium is insignificant (p=0.934 for the adoption index) as
 predicted in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "types of farmers"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

; the effect on adopting farmers that correctly estimate production is also
 insignificant as expected (p=0.998 for the adoption index).
 Taken together, these findings are consistent with the theory.

\end_inset

, we expect a positive effect of the treatment on farmers' knowledge.
 This effect is likely to be stronger for farmers that adopt at baseline,
 and particularly for the subgroup that adopted at baseline and also overestimat
ed potential yield (Type 3 farmers in Table

 The first column (1) provides the mean in the control group (with standard

 We see that knowledge is already high, which is likely to reduce statistical
 power for these comparisons.
 For example, 87 percent of farmers in the control group know that recommended

 also important when using improved varieties.

Column (2) shows the estimated difference between the treatment and control

 Column (3) also reports this difference, but only for the subset of farmers

 Finally, column (4) reports treatment effects for Type 3 farmers (who both
 adopt and overestimate production at baseline).
 The rationale for restricting our sample is alluded to in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

: because the restricted sample retains farmers for whom the treatment effect

We can (and do) also estimate treatment effects for Type 1 and Type 5 farmers.
 However, as Type 3 farmers are of primary interest in this paper, we only
 report on these farmers in the tables (and comment on the estimates of
 the other Types in the text to highlight that also these results are broadly
 consistent with the theory).

We find that knowledge, as measured by the quiz questions, increases for
 all variables (except for the control question), and generally more so
 for the subset of farmers that used an improved variety at baseline.
 For instance, the share of farmers that knows complementary inputs and
 practices are at least as important when using improved varieties increases
 from 87.1 to 89.3 percent.
 Furthermore, the share of farmers that recommends investing in different
 inputs (as opposed to investing all money in only one input), increases
 from 73.5 to 75.7 percent.
 If we only consider farmers that adopted at baseline, the increase over
 the control amounts to about 8 percent.
 Further restricting the sample to only Type 3 farmers leads to an average
 treatment effect of 12 percent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After adjusting standard errors for clustering at the village level, none
 of the differences for the entire sample is statistically significant at
 conventional levels.
 However, if we only consider the subset of farmers that adopted at baseline,
 we see that the intervention significantly increased overall knowledge
 (as measured by the index).
 This overall effect is driven by increased knowledge about optimal agricultural
 investments among treated farmers.
 If we single out Type 3 farmers, the index looses its significance.
 The fact that this happens despite a larger effect size for the variable
 that drives the result suggests statistical power issues due to small sample
 size.

 At the same time, we expected stronger effects.
 Ex-post, it turned out that many of the farmers were already able to indicate
 the correct response, and hence there is little scope for further improvement.
 However, as knowledge does not automatically translate into action, making
 information that is known more salient may still lead to behavior change

\begin_layout Subsection
Impact on use of inputs and practices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we investigate how the intervention affects the use of inputs (other
 than seed) and practices.
 Recall that for inputs and practices, the effect is expected to be positive,
 but only weakly so (see Prediction 4 in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Theoretical-framework"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We examine a range of cultivation practices and complementary inputs in
 line with what is featured in both treatment and control videos.
 The first outcome is an indicator for single–stand row planting.
 Row planting is an important management practice that can lead to significant
 yield gains.
 Under row planting, space is used optimally such that plants have sufficient
 nutrients, sunlight, and room to grow.
 However, row planting increases workload, meaning farmers often engage
 in broadcast planting, which is less demanding on their labor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reducing the seeding rate (i.e., the number of seeds sown) is the second outcome
 of interest.
 Farmers often plant more seed than necessary because they fear that it
 may not germinate.
 However, using more than two seeds per hill leads to stunted maize growth
 due to competition for light and nutrients.
 At the same time, just as for row planting, a lower seed rate may increase
 the workload, as farmers need to engage in gap filling after one week if
 seeds fail to germinate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next three outcomes relate to fertilizer use.
 The application of organic fertilizer is important for soil structure,
 while inorganic fertilizers such as di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) or nitrogen,
 phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) and urea (nitrogen) are used to provide
 essential nutrients at particular points in time.
 The cost of organic fertilizer is mainly in terms of labor, whereas both
 DAP and urea need to be bought from an agro-input shop and applied during
 planting (DAP) and at early stages of growth (urea).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Farmers should weed within the first week after planting and as often as
 possible.
 Official recommendations are to weed at least three times per seasons.
 Furthermore, invasive insects such as the fall armyworm (
\emph on
Spodoptera frugiperda
\emph default
) or maize stalk borer (
\emph on
Busseola fusca
\emph default
) can severely reduce yields.
 Pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides are widely available
 in agro-input shops under commercial names such as Rocket, Lalafos and
 Dudu acelamectin.
 While weeding requires labor, pesticides come at a pecuniary cost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we look at differences in re-sowing or gap-filling.
 This involves revisiting the plot after planting and inspecting the hills
 for seed germination.
 If a seed does not germinate, a new seed is planted in that location.
 Re-sowing, reduced seed rate, and row-planting are thus likely to be correlated.
 We also combine all outcomes in an overall index following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and show no impact of the intervention on the use of inputs and practices.
 As in previous tables, Columns (1) reports means for outcomes before the
 treatment.
 Column (2) shows that farmers do not invest more effort in response to
 the intervention.
 On the contrary (and especially if we only consider the subset of farmers
 that adopted at baseline, see Column (3)), farmers appear to be less likely
 to plant in rows.
 The negative effect on some practices may be due to the fact that farmers
 may adopt some complementary inputs or practices, but in insufficient quantitie
s and/or suboptimal combinations for the adoption premium to realize.
 When farmers subsequently dis-adopt, they may also stop using these inputs
 or practices, leading to a negative expected effect on practices for Type
 3 farmers in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "types of farmers"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 In particular, for the case of row planting, it may be that farmers that
 adopt at baseline simply follow planting instructions that are typically
 printed on the seed bags.
 However, only row-planting without additional inputs such as fertilizer
 or pesticide use may not lead to expected yields, and disappointed farmers
 may dis-adopt in the next season which case they may also revert to plating
 methods used before adoption.
 Finally, when we isolate the effect on Type 3 farmers, we find no significant
 effect on the index.

Since the intervention is designed to affect farmer behavior by

 We also measure harvest-related outcomes (production and yield) on a randomly
 selected maize plot.
 The three outcomes are also combined in an index following

Column (2) shows that, in line with our prediction, a significantly higher
 share of farmers in the treatment group state that they produced what they
 expected.
 The effect is larger for the subset of farmers that adopted at baseline,
 see Column (3).
 If we focus on (Type 3) farmers that adopted but also held inflated expectation
s, the positive effect becomes insignificant (Column 4).
 For Type 5 farmers the effect size is somewhat larger than for type 3 farmers,
 but still insignificant (p-value 0.188).
 In line with predictions, the effect on expectation is insignificant for
 farmers that have correct expectations (p-value 0.973).
 Again, taken together, this suggests that a subset of farmers indeed started
 out with inflated expectations, which were

\begin_layout Standard
This paper was motivated by the observation that farmers often seem to be
 unaware that many agricultural technologies such as improved seed varieties
 require substantial complementary inputs, better management practices,
 and greater effort for their benefits to realize.
 In a sense, farmers thus overestimate the returns to a technology and are
 disappointed when they compare expectations to realized yields.
 As learning about a new technology is hard, farmers may attribute the disappoin
ting results to the technology itself and dis-adopt in the next season.
 This is consistent with findings suggesting that farmers blame poor returns
 on inputs they believe to be counterfeit or of low quality even when objective
 quality assessments show otherwise

\begin_layout Standard
To test the hypothesis that farmers think of improved varieties as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

miracle seed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, we conducted a field experiment built around a short, engaging video on
 recommended input use and management practices for maize cultivation in
 eastern Uganda.
 More in particular, we produced two versions of the video that differ only
 in terms of the presence of explicit messaging about the importance of
 using complementary inputs such as fertilizer and practices such as weeding
 when using improved seed.
 Screenings of the two versions were randomly assigned to villages in our
 study area, and then to maize farmers in those villages, resulting in a
 sample of almost 3,500 farmers who were interviewed at regular intervals
 to uncover any changes in their knowledge about best practices in maize
 cultivation as well as their seed or variety choices, their expectations
 of yield and output, and their use of complementary inputs and management
 practices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we do not find treatment effects that differ significantly from zero
 for knowledge outcomes for the entire sample, we do observe that all coefficien
ts move in the expected direction and suspect that the lack of statistical
 significance may be caused by low power given an already high level of
 knowledge among our sampled farmers.
 We do find, consistent with our theory, that the intervention significantly
 improved knowledge for farmers that adopted at baseline, since for this
 subset of farmers the information is likely to be most useful.
 Further reducing the sample to farmers that adopt at baseline and also
 overestimate the adoption premium increases the treatment effect on one
 knowledge outcome, but the smaller sample also means the overall knowledge
 effect becomes insignificant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the main outcome of interest—behavior related to seed choices—we find
 that treated farmers were less likely to use improved varieties, and generally
 more likely to dis-adopt.
 Also here, this effect is replicated for farmers that adopt at baseline
 and overestimate the adoption premium (but increasingly smaller sample
 sizes make parameter estimates less precise).
 Also in line with the theory, we find no effect on adoption if we single
 out farmers that adopt at baseline and correctly predict future production,
 nor do we find an effect for farmers that adopt at baseline and underestimate
 the adoption premium.
 We also find that farmers that received the treatment were more likely
 to report that their harvest was in line with what they expected.
 No effects were found for use of complementary inputs and practices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The treatment effect on adoption could imply that treated farmers dis-adopt
 permanently if the video makes the hidden price of adopting more salient
 to them and reduces their expected profits.
 Alternatively, the observed dis-adoption could be dis-adoption that would
 have happened anyway if the video reduces a bias and accelerates a learning
 process towards more realistic expectations.
 In the latter case, the effect is likely to be short-lived and there will
 be lower dis-adoption in subsequent seasons for two reasons.
 Firstly, if the treatment only accelerated dis-adoption that would have
 happened anyway, part of this dis-adoption process will have now also started
 in the control group: a share of control farmers with biased expectations
 that initially adopted will have experienced a disappointing harvest, adjusted
 their expectations, and dis-adopted.
 Secondly, a share of treated farmers that initially dis-adopted will re-adopt:
 information about complementarities and changes in perceptions may reduce
 their risk premia, particularly in the longer run.
 In this scenario, farmers try improved seed with complementary inputs and
 learn that outcomes are consistently in line with expectations.
 They may experience that combining improved technologies with complementary
 inputs is consistently more profitable.
 And even if margins are lower, they may trade off the reduction in risk
 with increased investment.
 This is in line with what we find looking at data from subsequent seasons:
 when we revisit the farmers after one additional agricultural season, we
 no longer find any differences between treatment and control groups.

 At least some treated farmers who had dis-adopted in response to new informatio
n and more realistic expectations are, in fact, cultivating the new variety
 again; these may now be in for the long run.
 This indicates that the video did not increase dis-adoption per se; it
 only accelerated dis-adoption that was going to happen at some point.

If we'd like to comment more on results in Bulte, E, S di Falco, M Kassie

 returns: Experimental evidence from Tanzania.” The Review of Economics &
 Statistics, In Press: "In a recently published paper, [bulte_freeseed]
 confirm that farmers cannot learn about the returns of adopting improved
 technologies if they do not work sufficiently on their plots, and that
 this behavioral response may lead to dis-adoption.
 However, our results differ from this and other studies that find that
 improved technologies increase agricultural productivity by crowding in
 modern inputs and cultivation practices [10.1257/aer.20150474, bulte_freeseed]."

 do discuss the possibility that their effects are driven by an income effect.
 However, in the presence of an income effect, they understand the effect
 of the additional income resulting from the adoption of the technology
 (a flood-tolerant rice variety).
 The income effect we are concerned about is one that results from farmers
 receiving seed for free, potentially freeing up money for other investments.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In our experiment, no free seed was provided, so when adoption decisions
 were made, farmers had to take the combined cost of seed

 cost of complementary inputs into account, further eroding the expected
 profitability of the improved technology.

\begin_layout Standard
Our findings have implications for the study of technology adoption dynamics.
 If disappointment about the performance of a technology is erroneously
 attributed to the technology itself amd this learning failure is not corrected—
for instance, by pointing out that the seed is good; the problem is with
 complementary input use—farmers move into a potentially long periods of
 consistent under-adoption even if it is profitable for them.

Note that new varieties are introduced now and then and extension workers
 and successful neighbors may convince farmers to try again.
 So farmers are likely to adopt again after some seasons, but generally
 only the be disappointed again.

 Furthermore, as negative experiences tend to stick more and negative news
 may travel faster, exaggerated expectations and subsequent dis-adoption
 may further complicating (social) learning

Our study also casts some doubt on the suggestion that Bayesian learning
 via sequential adoption can be a successful strategy for smallholder farmers
 in the long run

 If there are important interaction effects between technologies, inputs
 and practices, it seems unreasonable to assume that farmers can try out
 all possible combinations of inputs to learn about these interactions in
 a Bayesian fashion, at least within a reasonable time frame.
 This suggests their is an important role for agricultural extension and
 advisory services when introducing new technologies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our findings also have implications for how public and private actors in
 the agriculture sector should promote new technologies.
 If smallholders' information sources such as private input dealers and
 public extension agents are not sufficiently able to communicate the importance
 of complementary inputs and practices, then lower likelihoods of sustained
 adoption may result.
 Worse, if smallholders have incorrect perceptions about poor quality caused
 by misattribution, the persistence of these perceptions may crowd out the
 market for quality inputs

 And while the distribution of free or subsidized technologies and inputs
 may go some way in encouraging farmers' learning processes and

 their perceptions (for example, with unique standalone technologies

\end_inset

), this approach can break down when complementary inputs and practices
 are not part of the package, which may again lead to disappointment among
 farmers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our findings further suggest that agricultural development programs, extension
 providers, and agri-input companies need to focus less on marketing single

 technologies for smallholders, and more on the design and communication
 of comprehensive packages that include both agronomic and economic information
 on topics such as expected variation in yield and output, sensitivity of
 timing for specific farming tasks, magnitude and costs of family and hired
 labor, and the relative drudgery of effort, among many others.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Another argument in favor of promoting packages instead of single technologies
 is provided by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

 who find that the promotion of modern seed varieties led to farmers increasingl
y deforesting primary forest to satisfy their higher demand for soil nutrients
 and nitrogen.
 We conclude that the design and communication of comprehensive packages
 requires greater investment in the form and content of rural education,
 extension and advisory services, and agri-input marketing strategies.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, while we find some evidence to support our theory, we do feel that
 more research is needed.
 For instance, it is unclear whether the small effects on knowledge are
 due to farmers already knowing about the importance of complementary input
 use, or due to a poor choices of questions to measure knowledge.
 If farmers indeed do not lack knowledge, the fact that we do find significant
 effects on seed use suggest behavioral barriers to adoption, such as inertia
 or procrastination, and alternative interventions may be even more effective.
 Future studies may consider an improved experimental design, for instance
 by blocking on farmer type instead of simply calculating conditional means
 ex-post, and a more appropriate questionnaire that also attempts to capture
 behavioral impact pathways.
