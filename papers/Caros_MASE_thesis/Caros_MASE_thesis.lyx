Quality constraints to agricultural technology adoption: Can an information
 clearinghouse save the Ugandan market for seed?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Agricultural technologies remain under-adopted among smallholder farmers
 in sub-Saharan Africa.
 We investigate how the quality of an agricultural input affects its adoption.
 As the quality of maize seed is easier to observe for sellers than for
 buyers, we hypothesize that this information asymmetry leads to poor seed
 quality offered by agro-input dealers, resulting in under-adoption by farmers.
 To overcome this classic lemons technology problem, we implement a crowd-source
d information clearinghouse similar to yelp.com in the market for seed, meaning
 that we collect and disseminate farmers' ratings of seed quality.
 This intervention is tested in a randomized controlled trial among 350
 agro-input dealers and 3500 smallholder maize farmers in Uganda.
 Midline data shows that dealers increase their efforts and improve their
 services in response to the clearinghouse.
 Treated farmers are also more likely to switch from one to another shop.
 There are some indications that these two mechanisms eventually lead to
 better maize seed quality but endline data has to be analyzed before we
 can draw conclusions.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa do not sufficiently adopt agricultural
 technologies like high yielding seed varieties and fertilizers, even though
 these inputs are seen as the key to agricultural productivity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "de2016agricultural"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 As a result, differences in agricultural yields between sub-Saharan Africa
 and countries in Latin America and Asia have almost doubled since 1961
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1146/annurev-resource-100517-023202"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Experts argue that the substantial growth in yields in these countries
 can largely be explained by increased adoption whereas the stagnation of
 yields in sub-Saharan Africa can mostly be explained low adoption 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "morris2007fertilizer"

\end_inset

.
 At the individual level, farmers who do not adopt miss out on increased
 yields and farm profits 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "suri2011selection"

\end_inset

, and potentially on a way out of poverty and a better life.
 Also at the aggregate level, the lag in adoption has high costs in terms
 of economic development and human welfare and is holding back the reduction
 of rural food insecurity and poverty.
 That is why it is important to identify the drivers of and constraints
 to agricultural technology adoption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In line with the general trend in economics, these drivers and constraints
 have increasingly been studied using field experiments 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "de2016agricultural,de2017field"

\end_inset

.
 For instance, the Agricultural Technology Adoption Initiative (ATAI), a
 collaboration between MIT's Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL)
 and UC Berkeley's Center for Effective Global Action (CEGA), has funded
 a series of field experiments to illuminate what helps and hinders adoption
 among smallholder farmers.
 The literature has identified several key constraints which include poor
 access to information 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ashraf2009finding"

, farmers' behavioral constraints like procrastination and time-inconsistent
 preferences 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, heterogeneity in uncertainty and the net benefits to the technology due
 to infrastructure and high transaction costs

, missing markets for risk and credit

\begin_layout Standard
This study addresses a particular constraint to technology adoption: the
 perceived quality of agricultural inputs in the market, which has received
 considerable attention from top journals 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bold2017lemon,MICHELSON2021102579"

\end_inset

 and policy makers recently.
 To this end, we look at Ugandan 
\shape italic
improved maize seed varieties
\shape default
, which are high yielding cultivars like open-pollinated and hybrid maize
 varieties.
 Maize is an important crop in Uganda, both for home consumption and as
 a source of income.
 Yet, the uptake of improved varieties by smallholder farmers remains below
 the optimum, despite the higher yield potential compared to traditional
 varieties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because agricultural input quality is hardly observable, information asymmetries
 between sellers and buyers characterize the markets for seed and fertilizer.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bold2017lemon"

\end_inset

 argue that the Ugandan market for improved maize seed appears similar to
 the market for used cars described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

’s classic study 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyearpar
key "george1970market"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 In such a market where the quality is easier to observe for the seller
 than for the buyer, there is no incentive for vendors to sell good products
 and average quality can degrade.
 That is why recent studies claim that smallholder adoption of agricultural
 inputs, and of improved maize seed in Uganda in particular, is limited
 by farmers’ beliefs that the inputs are of poor quality - counterfeited,
 adulterated, or otherwise not performing 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 These studies provide empirical evidence of Ugandan agricultural inputs
 being lemons and also in our sample, 69% of farmers think that seed which
 is sold at agro-input shops is fake.
 In line with this literature, we hypothesize that the intentional and unintenti
onal malpractices of dealers lead to poor seed quality, resulting in under-adopt
ion by smallholder farmers.
 These quality issues might therefore constrain the emergence and sustainability
 of an efficient seed system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To assess the importance of this potential constraint to agricultural technology
 adoption, we test an intervention which reduces the information asymmetry
 between seller and buyer by making the quality of maize seed observable.
 We implement a decentralized information clearinghouse that is based on
 crowd-sourced ratings and works through reputational mechanisms, much like
 yelp.com or tripadvisor.com, in the market for seed.
 This means that we aggregate the experiences of many users by collecting
 the ratings of smallholder farmers to reveal the quality of maize seed.
 Then we disseminate these ratings back to farmers and dealers.
 The treatment targets the interaction between farmers and agro-input dealers
 who sell improved seed and play a crucial role in the seed system because
 they form a key link between seed producers and users.
 This crowd-sourced information clearinghouse is tested in a randomized
 controlled trial among 350 agro-input dealers and 3500 smallholder maize
 farmers in Uganda.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Midline data shows that dealers increase their efforts and improve their
 services in response to the clearinghouse.
 Treated farmers are also more likely to switch from one to another shop.
 There are some indications that these two mechanisms eventually lead to
 better maize seed quality.
 Heterogeneity analysis suggests that the clearinghouse works better for
 dealers who only sell farm inputs, for dealers who face more competition
 and for dealers who were known by at least one farmer in the sample, so
 that they received a rating.
 However, endline data has to be analyzed before we can confidently draw
 conclusions.

Agro-input dealers

The clearinghouse targets the interaction between the farmer and the agro-input
 dealer.
 Agro-input shops are businesses that sell inputs and equipment used in
 agricultural production, such as improved seed

, fertilizers, and other agricultural technologies.
 These dealers play an important role in the seed system because they create
 a market for agricultural technologies, develop and disseminate knowledge,
 and sometimes even perform additional tasks like providing farm credit
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Furthermore, they are part of an important network with connections to
 actors across the value chain, such as manufacturers of inputs, government
 organizations and other agribusinesses.
 While the importance of these actors in the seed supply chain seems straightfor
ward and some authors emphasize the role of private agents 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "de2016agricultural"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, there are very few studies which target these shops.
 As the shops form a key link between the producers and users of agricultural
 technologies, the activities of these dealers play an important role and
 quality issues may arise at their level.
 That is why our clearinghouse specifically targets agro-input shops and
 dealers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As Ugandan farmers can hardly assess the quality of improved maize seed
 prior to purchase, we hypothesize that agro-input dealers exploit this
 information asymmetry, and that their malpractices lead to poor seed quality.
 In a context relatively similar to ours, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hoffmann2021observability"

\end_inset

 look at maize grain as an output in rural Kenya and find that there is
 no incentive for sellers to address food safety losses because they are
 not observable for buyers, so that there is no correlation between prices
 and this unobservable quality attribute.

 Agro-input dealers may sacrifice quality to increase profits, for instance
 by mixing good seed with poor seed to cut costs.
 Mind that these dealers operate in markets with weak, under-resourced instituti

 There is empirical evidence of this kind of adulteration at some point
 in the Ugandan agricultural input supply chain.

 and policy makers.
 A National Seed Policy report written by the Ugandan Ministry of Agriculture,
 Animal Industry and Fisheries states that 30-40% of seed traded in the
 market is counterfeit 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Also in our sample, 69% of farmers think that maize seed that is sold at
 shops is adulterated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, these malpractices may be 
\shape italic
unintentional
\shape default
.
 Poor seed handling and storage may lead to deterioration in quality.
 The agro-input dealer may thus sell seed of inferior quality without intending
 to do so.
 There is also some evidence of this kind of quality reduction.
 In a comprehensive study of the Ugandan seed supply chain, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "BARRIGA2020104928"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 document various issues related to handling and storage that may reduce
 the quality of this input.
 For example, smallholder farmers often need smaller quantities than what
 is packaged in standard bags, and dealers thus often repackage in sub-optimal
 environments.
 Poor rotation of seed stock and storage in open bags, in moist conditions
 or in direct sunlight also reduce seed quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These intentional and unintentional malpractices at the dealer level may
 lead to poor agricultural input quality.
 Purchasing poor inputs will lead to disappointing experiences at the farmer
 level.
 This will reduce their willingness to pay.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "gharib2021fear"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 find that concerns about seed quality reduce farmers’ willingness to invest
 in seeds, as farmers are willing to pay 15% more for bags directly from
 the seed company than for bags from local retailers.
 Due to farmers’ beliefs that the inputs are of poor quality, their seed
 adoption will be low.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

 Smallholder farmers under-adopt agricultural inputs because they perceive

The potential solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This classic lemons technology problem can be solved by reducing information
 asymmetries between the two parties.
 In Kenya, seed companies have started marketing their seed using novel
 packaging features to signal product quality and authenticity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "gharib2021fear"

\end_inset

.
 Uganda does regulate seed quality by means of certifications and standards,
 but they provide farmers with a relatively weak and unreliable indication
 of quality.
 We bought seed bags from agro-input dealers in our sample, and only 8%
 of them have a certification sticker from an inspection agency.
 Alternatives such as electronic verification systems have also been experimente
d with, but the cost of implementation has proven challenging, and they
 depend on the reliability of the underlying seed certification system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That is why we test an alternative, decentralized clearinghouse that is
 based on crowd-sourced information and works through reputational mechanisms,
 much like yelp.com or tripadvisor.com.
 Studies in other contexts have shown that new crowd-based sources of pre-purcha
se information can be particularly useful.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "reimers2021digitization"

\end_inset

 look at books and compare the impacts of professional critics and Amazon
 star ratings of these experience goods on consumer welfare.
 The aggregate effect of star ratings on consumer surplus is more than ten
 times the effect of traditional review outlets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Information clearinghouse mechanisms in developing countries have been studied
 to some extent, but mostly to address market price information asymmetries
 between smallholder farmers and middlemen.
 Assuming that middlemen are better informed about prevailing prices in
 the market than farmers, theory suggests that providing farmers with price
 information increases their bargaining power.
 However, evidence is mixed: while 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "10.2307/25760218"

\end_inset

 finds that internet kiosks that provide wholesale price information significant
ly increase soy prices in India, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "fafchamps2012impact"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 do not find a statistically significant effect of market information delivered
 to farmers' mobile phones in a neighboring state.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A clearinghouse that relies on crowd-sourced ratings may be more effective
 in increasing seed quality in the market.
 While prices can generally be observed reasonably easy, assessing an experience
 or credence good such as seed is much more difficult.
 At the time of purchase, visual seed inspection is limited to seed purity
 and the presence of mold.
 Aggregating the experiences of many users may thus be a particularly powerful
 way to reveal the quality of the product.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A study by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hasanain2019no"

\end_inset

, who set up a rating system for public veterinary services in Pakistan,
 is probably the closest to ours.
 They find that farmers who use the clearinghouse enjoy a 25% higher success
 rate of artificial insemination.
 Their research suggests that this is mostly due to increased veterinarian
 effort, as few farmers seem to be switching from veterinaries that receive
 poor ratings to veterinaries that receive good ratings.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeauthor
key "hasanain2019no"

\end_inset

's study, veterinaries provide their services directly, without an intermediary.
 Reducing asymmetric information can be even more important in markets with
 intermediaries like agro-input dealers, where producers do not sell to
 consumers directly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hence a crowd-sourced information clearinghouse can be an important institutiona
l innovation to solve the problem of asymmetric information in the market
 for agricultural inputs and may affect both intentional and non-intentional
 quality reductions.
 It may be preferable to alternative strategies due to its likely lower
 cost, self-sustaining nature and scaleability, and helps to overcome problems
 such as insufficient public investment in regulatory systems, regulatory
 enforcement, and market surveillance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\series bold
hypothesis 3:
\series default
 An information clearinghouse reduces malpractices at the agro-input dealer
 level and in turn improves smallholder farmers' perception and adoption

\begin_layout Standard
An information clearinghouse could work through different impact pathways
 which are illustrated in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 Firstly, farmers who did not buy (or who bought only a little) seed before
 may start adopting (or start adopting more) improved seed when they realize
 that an agro-input dealer in their vicinity has a good rating, meaning
 that the quality of the seed sold there is better than expected.
 The literature indicates that this pathway of improving the perception
 of quality without actually improving quality could be very relevant.

 establish that the nutrient content of fertilizer in Tanzania is good and
 meets industry standards but that farmers believe that it is adulterated.
 One would simply need to correct farmers’ beliefs which are inconsistent
 with the reality to increase adoption.
 Also 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "wossen2022misperceiving"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 show that farmers in developing countries routinely misperceive input quality
 and that rectifying this misperception may improve farmers’ investment
 choices and productivity outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Secondly, farmers could switch from low rated shops to higher rated shops
 after learning that their usually chosen agro-input dealer received a poor
 rating.
 Alternatively, farmers may pressure their usual dealers to increase efforts.
 Dealers could also start improving on their own (i.e.
 without the pressure of farmers) after they have learned that their seed
 is rated poorly and want to improve their products.
 Lastly, dealers could also increase their efforts after seeing that they
 were rated well and feel motivated and satisfied due to this reward.
 All these scenarios lead to seed of better quality, farmers purchasing
 better seed which improves their experiences by reducing risk and increasing
 profitability and later their perception of seed.
 Ultimately, this is expected to lead to increased adoption of improved
 maize seed.
 In the long run, the improved reputation of agro-input dealers could also
 boost seed producers' trust in them, which could lead to better support
 etc.

(Un)observable maize seed quality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we are certain that it is impossible to accurately determine maize
 seed quality on the basis of visual examination before purchase, it remains
 up to discussion whether farmers can infer quality after experiencing the
 good.
 If farmers could observe the quality of seed perfectly after using it once,
 i.e.
 after one agricultural season, there would be no need for a clearinghouse
 as Ugandan farmers plant maize twice a year and could infer relatively
 fast which agro-input dealer provides good quality.
 If farmers could not observe the quality of maize seed at all, also not
 after adopting it, there would also be no use of a clearinghouse, as their
 ratings would be useless.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the one hand, farmers can somewhat infer maize seed quality after one
 season.
 Shortly after planting, farmers can observe germination rates, i.e.
 the proportion of seeds that germinate, and later how fast the seed matures.
 Some seed may also be more susceptible to pests and diseases, while other
 seed may be particularly tolerant in terms of drought.
 After harvest, the farmer can observe the yield.
 All these attributes of seed quality can be judged to some extent after
 one agricultural season.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, farmers’ ability to infer seed quality must be somewhat
 limited, since we would otherwise expect prices to be correlated with observabl
e quality, so that counterfeiting and adulteration would be less prevalent.
 For smallholders, it remains difficult to assess quality ex-post because
 there are so many factors at play.
 If a farmer experiences a disappointing harvest, he or she cannot safely
 conclude that the seed material was poor because it could have also been
 poor soil, insufficient, late or too much rain, or own mismanagement like
 late planting or insufficient weeding.
 Misattribution occurs when farmers mistakenly ascribe bad outcomes to bad
 inputs, rather than to other possible causes.
 Learning about the true quality becomes more difficult when this misattribution
 is present (Hoel et al., 2021).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion, improved maize seed lies somewhere on the continuum between
 experience goods and credence goods.
 While a farmer cannot safely infer quality from only his or her experience,
 the aggregation of the experiences of many users may be a powerful way
 to reveal the quality of the product.
 Even if a farmer observes impressive yield and correctly infers that the
 quality of the seed they used is good, he or she perceives this as only
 one source, as only one observation.
 The extension literature shows that a smallholder is more likely to trust
 that information if it comes from more than one source, e.g.
 from a clearinghouse rating that is computed based on multiple opinions.

Level of randomization
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To evaluate the impact of the clearinghouse, we conduct a randomized controlled
 trial (RCT).
 We randomize at area level because randomizing at the level of the individual
 agro-input shop prompted ethical concerns.
 Often, dealers are clustered in towns, villages, markets, trading centers
 and other key market sheds.
 Two or more dealers may operate in the same neighborhood, or in the same
 street or even right next to each other.
 If we would randomize at shop level, one dealer may get assigned to the
 clearinghouse treatment group and receive a good rating, while his or her
 neighbor gets assigned to the clearinghouse control group and does not
 get the chance to receive any rating.
 Farmers may prefer the dealer with the rating, even though the seed quality
 of the control dealer may be similar or even better.
 The rating would in this case lead to a competitive advantage for the treated
 dealer, but the reverse may also be true if the treated dealer gets a poor
 rating.
 Randomizing at area level reduces the risk of harming someone with our
 experiment.
 As it is important to think about the ethics of experimentation, especially
 when the participants are vulnerable 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "NBERw27600"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, we opted to be more ethical at the expense of statistical power.
 To compensate this loss in power, we undergo the extra costs and logistic
 challenges of having a much larger sample than the one we would have needed
 if we would have randomized at the level of the individual dealer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\shape italic
catchment area
\shape default
 is defined as the area that is served by an agro-input dealer, as the area
 where this shop's customers live.
 If the catchment areas of two or more shops overlap because these dealers
 operate in the same town, street or right next to each other, they are
 assigned to the same catchment area.
 This is done on the basis of geographical location.
 Using GPS coordinates of the dealers, the haversine function is used to
 construct an adjacency matrix, and dealers that are less than 5 kilometer
 apart are assigned to the same catchment area.
 The 5 kilometer threshold was selected based on visual inspection of the
 map, the size of an average village and reported distance between farmers
 and dealers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another benefit of randomizing at catchment area level is that it allows
 us to measure the effect of the clearinghouse on agro-input dealers and
 on farmers.
 If we would randomize at shop level, one dealer may be rated but his or
 her neighbor may not.
 Some farmers would then have access to treated and control dealers, so
 that it would be difficult to distinguish treatment and control farmers.
 That is why we could hardly measure the effect of our intervention of farmer
 outcomes.
 If we want to know if the clearinghouse leads to e.g.
 increased improved maize seed adoption among farmers, we need to be able
 to connect each farmer unambiguously to treatment or control.
 We ensure this by randomizing at the catchment area level because then
 all dealers within an area are rated (or not) and all farmers within that
 area are potential customers of only dealers who are (or not).
 Furthermore, randomizing at catchment area level erases any spillover concerns.
 Otherwise treated dealers might for example inform control dealers nearby
 that they will be rated soon, which would contaminate the control group.

Factorial design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The clearinghouse is part of a larger project which evaluates the effects
 of different interventions.
 In this field experiment, various treatment and control groups are randomly
 assigned to different combinations of treatment and control conditions.
 We used a 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{3}$
\end_inset

 factorial design because we tested the impact of three interventions.
 The other two treatments are not of interest for this paper.
 Factorial designs allow the recycling of treated units as controls in the
 orthogonal factor.
 As such, to estimate main effects, less observations are needed than with
 parallel designs.

\begin_layout Standard
We used simulations to determine the sample sizes for this experimental
 layout.
 Simulating, so that the experiment is run thousands of times and one simply
 counts how frequently the treatment comes up significant, provides a flexible
 and intuitive way to analyze power.
 Furthermore, instead of relying on theoretical distributions for the outcome
 variables that take assumptions and return analytic solutions, simulations
 can sample from real data.
 Here, we use survey data from 78 agro-input dealers and 1,529 smallholder
 farmers in the catchment areas of these dealers that were collected in
 three districts in eastern Uganda in July 2019

\end_inset

 contains more detailed information on which outcome variables are considered
 and which treatment effect sizes are assumed.
 To determine the sample size (defined in terms of the number of catchment
 areas), the algorithm iterates over different candidate sample sizes.
 For each candidate sample size, a random sample with replacement is drawn
 from the survey data.
 This sample is then used to run a number of simulations of the experiment.
 In particular, for each simulation, all dealers that are in half of the
 catchment areas are assigned to the treatment condition and the other half
 to the control condition.
 To the outcomes of interest that are assigned to the treatment condition,
 the assumed effect is added and the analysis is conducted.
 In our case, we are interested in the average treatment effect, so we simply
 regress the outcome on a treatment indicator and record if the coefficient
 on the treatment indicator is significant at the 5% level.
 Finally, we determine how often, out of the total number of simulations,
 we are able to detect the effect at the 5% significance level.
 This will give us the power associated with that particular candidate sample
 size.
 Power can then be plotted against sample size to obtain power curves as
 is shown in detail in the appendix

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once we determined the minimum number of catchment areas (and corresponding
 dealers) that are necessary to detect effects at the level of the agro-input
 dealer, we fix the number of catchment areas there to then determine the
 number of farmers we need to sample per dealer to the identify impact of
 the interventions on that level.
 To make sure we have sufficient farmers to rate each dealer, we allocate
 a fixed number of farmers to each dealer.
 This means that we have slightly differing numbers of farmers in the different
 treatment groups, as the randomization happens at the catchment area level.
 While this may reduce power somewhat, this does not bias impact estimates.
 We iterate over different candidate sample sizes of farmers per dealer.
 The resulting sample in each iterations is used to run a number of simulations
 of the experiment.
 For each simulation, all farmers that are in the catchment area of input
 dealers that are in half of the catchment areas are assigned to the treatment
 condition and all other farmers are assigned to the control condition.
 To the farmer level outcomes of interest that are assigned to the treatment
 condition in this way, the assumed effect is added and the analysis is
 conducted.
 We again determine how often, out of the total number of simulations, we
 were able to detect the effect at the 5% significance level, which will
 give us the power associated to that iteration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that if the number of catchment areas is larger than 112, our experiment
s will return statistically significant results 80% of the time.
 This corresponds to about 318 agro-input dealers.
 Based on further simulations, we decided to collect information on 10 farmers
 per dealer, leading to a sample size of 3,200 households.
 We will collect more data to account for attrition.

Transparency and replicability

We went the extra mile in tying our hands to avoid any issues related to
 specification search, variable selection, fishing etc.
 Firstly, all documents, codes, and data related to this project are under
 revision control and publicly accessible via 
\begin_inset CommandInset href

\end_inset

 which provides time-stamped recordings of any changes made over the course
 of the project.
 All documents including this one were written with the open source LyX
 or LaTeX typesetting software which allows revision control.
 Secondly, we registered a pre-analysis plan.
 For detailed information about the study, we refer to this plan that can
 be found on the

.
 Thirdly, we completed the entire econometric analysis on simulated data
 and produced a mock report, all before midline data was collected.
 This report was registered and added to the AEA RCT registry and GitHub.
 Mock reports serve to tie the hands of researcher, reducing degrees of
 freedom in the choice of what specifications to run and what variables
 to include when testing hypotheses.

 of characteristics.
 To ensure that farmers certainly knew which dealer they were rating, we
 used the names of the shops and dealers, the nicknames and other names
 under which they may be known in the community (e.g.
 son of ...).
 Furthermore, we provided names of the markets, descriptions of the places
 and pictures of the shops which were collected during our census (see section

The responses of farmers to the questions which are outlined in table

 All ratings were collected 
\shape italic
after
\shape default
 harvest, when smallholders were able to assess seed quality based on observing
 germination and yield, the resistance of the seed against droughts, pests
 and diseases, and how fast the seed matures.
 The questions are carefully formulated and include "as advertised" because
 not every improved maize seed variety is e.g.
 particularly resistant to drought, i.e.
 some of these attributes are not quality dimensions of every seed variety.
 That is why no dealer should be punished for selling seed that is not drought
 tolerant unless he or she is intransparent about this or even uses deceptive
 marketing practices.
 Note that all questions deal with seed quality, not with other attributes
 that could distinguish good from poor dealers like their prices or services
 (e.g.
 whether or not a dealer offers credit or advice).
 The aim of the clearinghouse is to make unobservable

\begin_layout Subsection
Computation of ratings 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the answers of all farmers in a catchment area, we computed the
 ratings for each agro-input shop.
 These ratings were translated into words and stars, so that they are easily
 understandable for farmers and dealers who are not used to interpreting
 numbers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
What to do if a treated dealer does not receive a single rating?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a shop in a treated catchment area is not rated by a single farmer e.g.
 because no farmer in our sample knows him or her, we could fill in the
 catchment area mean as his or her rating.
 However, this is not as innocent as it seems because it is likely that
 the lack of ratings is not random.
 Poor quality dealers have less customers, so their likelihood to get rated
 is lower.
 Giving them average catchment area ratings inflates the ratings of these
 low quality dealers.
 Instead, we simply told farmers that we do not have information about this
 shop (implicitly informing the farmer that it exists), see also table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "SMS"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 16 of 193 treated dealers were not rated by a single farmer in the first
 round.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Should more ratings lead to better ratings?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some shops were not rated by any smallholder in the first round, while others
 were rated by up to 22 smallholders.
 If dealer A is rated by 10 farmers and gets rating 3,5 and dealer B is
 rated by 1 farmer and gets rating 3,6, we treat dealer B as the better
 dealer.
 Even though receiving many (few) ratings can be related to good (poor)
 quality (the lack of ratings could be nonrandom, see previous paragraph),
 there could be other reasons why dealers are rated by many (few) farmers.
 Furthermore, giving higher ratings to better-known dealers could harm new
 dealers entering the market and dealers who are discriminated e.g.
 due to their gender.
 Also on TripAdvisor, having more reviews than a rival hotel does not guarantee
 a higher ranking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Should ratings depend on catchment area dealer performance?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following examples show that ratings should not depend on catchment
 area averages.
 In an area with poor quality dealers in which one dealer is a bit better
 than the rest but still poor, we do not want this dealer to be rated well
 (i.e.
 expose farmers to poor quality dealers).
 Similarly, in an area with good dealers in which one dealer is a bit worse
 than the rest but still good, we do not want this dealer to be rated poorly
 (which would be unfair towards him or her).
 On the other hand, less than 9% of shops received a rating below 3 out
 of 5, so we would throw away valuable data if we would only disseminate
 good scores without any variation.
 Therefore, we take the distribution of ratings into account by using quintiles.
 Consequently, less dealers receive rating 4 or 5, more dealers receive
 rating 1 or 2.
 This could strengthen the effect of the treatment on dealer effort.
 If dealers get ratings 1 or 2 instead of 4 or 5, they could feel more inclined
 to improve their scores.
 Consequently, also the effect on seed quality itself could be larger.
 However, the clearinghouse should also have a signaling effect, which might
 be weaker if more dealers are rated 1 or 2 instead of 4 or 5 (dealers would
 seem to be of worse quality to farmers).
 Therefore, we chose words with a positive connotation as the quintile names
 for rating dissemination.
 As most dealers received a good or very good rating before taking the distribut
ion into account, we ensure that even a 2 is still communicated as "good"
 to farmers to not weaken the signaling effect.
 That is why the first quintile is translated to "okay" and gets one star,
 the second one is named "good" and receives two stars, the third quintile
 is "very good" and gets three stars, the fourth and fifth one are "excellent"
 and awarded with four and five stars.
 This way of considering the distribution of the original ratings when choosing
 the names also helps us to disseminate ratings as truthfully, purely and
 as closely to reality as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Are female dealers rated worse than male dealers?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because 41% of the agro-input dealers in our sample are female and women
 could be discriminated and hence perceived and rated worse, we tested whether
 there are significant differences between the ratings of female dealers
 and the ratings of male dealers.
 We controlled for some potentially confounding variables like age, education,
 distances to the nearest tarmac and murram roads (as measures of remoteness)
 and additionally for many indications of quality (whether the shop only
 sells farm inputs, years since shop establishment, questions related to
 the quality of the shop's roof, walls, ventilation, floor, lighting and
 seed storage, questions related to rats and pests, official certificates,
 cleanness and professionality, customer complaints, and temperature).
 Because we found a significant difference in ratings (Pr(>|t|) < 0.1) after
 controlling for all this, we have no reason to believe that this difference
 can be explained by real quality differences.
 Hence there is no other reason than discrimination for female dealers to
 be rated worse.
 Therefore, we adjusted the ratings of female dealers accordingly to prevent
 that they are harmed by our intervention.
 We changed the ratings of all female dealers by adding the coefficients
 of the gender dummy to the initial ratings.
 This means that we regressed all seed quality attributes on the gender
 dummy and add the resulting coefficients to these individual ratings.
 Then we did the same with the mean (summary) rating.

The first round of agro-input dealer ratings was disseminated in July and
 August 2021

before

 farmers started buying seed for the next agricultural season.
 In the treated catchment areas, farmers were provided with the ratings
 of all dealers in their proximity.
 Due to the pandemic and a Ugandan lockdown from June 18 until July 30 2021,
 our project faced a lot of uncertainty, especially because farmers and
 dealers needed to be treated before the start of the second agricultural
 season of 2021.
 That is why we decided to send text messages to safeguard the realization
 of the clearinghouse, even if the lockdown would have stayed in place and
 we would not have been able to visit farmers in person.
 To ensure that farmers received the necessary information before buying
 seed, we sent them one Short Message Service (SMS) per dealer in their
 catchment area in the beginning of July 2021, see figure

's study demonstrates the importance of these control SMS.
 They introduced a "Yellow Pages" phone directory with contact information
 for local enterprises in central Tanzania.
 They find that enterprises randomly assigned to be listed in the directory
 receive more business calls, make greater use of mobile money, and are
 more likely to employ workers.
 As we are not interested in this kind of knowledge effect (farmers knowing
 which dealers operate in their proximity), we also disseminate control
 dealer information, so that we are able to measure the pure clearinghouse
 effect of making unobservable seed quality observable.
 An additional advantage is that control farmers will also believe that
 they are somehow treated, so that treated and control farmers will adjust
 their behavior similarly and these effort responses do not explain the
 treatment effect, if we find one

In the second agricultural season of 2021, farmers started buying seed later
 than usual.
 Delayed rains in the first agricultural season delayed the first planting.
 Hence few farmers harvested as usual in July 2021 while most waited for
 maturity and harvested maize between mid-July and early August.
 Farmers cannot start second planting until the crop from the previous season
 is harvested.
 Besides, they need to sell some of the harvested maize to raise money for
 buying seed.
 Therefore, second season planting only took place in between mid-August
 and early September and farmers purchased seed later than usual.

.
 Luckily Ugandan regulations allowed us to go to the field immediately after
 the lockdown ended on July 30.
 Our enumerators re-visited all (treatment and control) farmers in the first
 half of August 2021 (see figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) and farmers were treated as initially planned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this purpose, we designed a visually appealing dissemination app which
 cycles through all dealers in the catchment area of each farmer.
 Again, to ensure that farmers could identify the dealer in question, we
 used the shop and owner names, nicknames and alternative names, location,
 a description and a photo of the shop.
 In the version designed for treated farmers, the cycling through dealers
 starts with the dealer with the highest rating.
 We used passive voice and converted ratings into words and stars: "We wanted
 to let you know that customers from input dealer x rate the quality of
 maize seed sold there as okay/good/very good/excellent! The quality of
 the maize seed that this agro-input shop sells got a score of 1/2/3/4/5
 out of 5!".
 Then the enumerator showed the stars after showing the photo of the shop
 again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To ensure that control farmers were also aware of the existence of dealers
 in their proximity (to separate the "knowledge effect" from the clearinghouse
 effect, see above in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "text about SMS"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) we also cycled through all dealers in control areas and asked a couple
 of questions e.g.
 "Do you know the agro-input shop called x?".
 This way, control farmers feel as treated as treatment farmers, which can
 be of importance

Dissemination of ratings to dealers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Agro-input dealers received their own ratings by means of a report on paper.
 It was delivered to the shops in July 2021, see figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "timeline"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The front shows a visually appealing certificate with a logo and the own
 general rating: "Input dealer x scores y out of 5.
 This was based on z reviews.
 This score means that farmers in the area think that the quality of the
 maize seed this shop sells is: okay/good/very good/excellent.
 SeedAdvisor certificate 2021." Scores, words and stars matched those disseminate
d to farmers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The back of the paper report showed more detailed information.
 In addition to the dealer's general rating, it shows the dealer's specific
 ratings (overall quality, yield, drought and disease resistance, speed
 of maturing, and germination) and the average ratings of other agro-input
 dealers in the same catchment area in a table, visualized by stars.
 This shows dealers their relative position in the area and could stimulate
 competition.
 Dealers were not informed about the individual ratings of their competitors,
 they only learned about the catchment area averages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The certificate can be used to display the ratings in the shop, similar
 to a "certificate of excellence" of TripAdvisor but dealers may or may
 not hang it.
 However, the person who visited all dealers and delivered their personalized
 certificates recommended hanging it, as they might not think about it themselve
s.
 There is also a note on the back of the report which recommends displaying
 the certificate in the shop.
 The delivering person also reminded dealers to read the information on
 the back so that dealers are fully informed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, we expect dealers to be more likely to change their behavior
 i.e.
 increase their efforts if they know that they will be scored again.
 They need to expect a second set of scores.
 That is why the person delivering the reports explicitly mentioned to every
 dealer that they will be scored again.
 Furthermore, there is a note on the report that informs dealers that they
 will be scored again in January 2022.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Further collection and dissemination of ratings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second round of agro-input dealer ratings was collected right after farmer
 midline data collection in January 2022, after farmers harvested in November
 or December and the second season of 2021 was over.
 Enumerators revisited farmers for the midline survey and collected the
 second dealer ratings in person.
 The resulting second clearinghouse ratings were disseminated to farmers
 and dealers between mid-January and mid-February 2022, before farmers started
 buying seed in February or March and planted seed in March or April.
 Farmers also received a second set of SMS in the beginning of March 2022.
 Finally, after the first agricultural season of 2022, the third round of
 dealer ratings will be collected as part of the endline data collection
 in July or August 2022 after farmers harvest maize in June or July.
 The third rating is a post-treatment outcome variable.
 Knowing that the clearinghouse will remain in place for some time could
 motivate dealers to change their behavior and increase farmers' trust in
 these ratings.

Specification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the random assignment to treatment and control groups, simply comparing
 outcome variable means of treatment and control participants provides unbiased
 estimates of the effect of the clearinghouse intervention on the outcomes
 of interest.
 Note that impact will be judged by looking at outcomes both at the agro-input
 dealer level as well as at the farmer level.
 To increase power, we condition the estimates on baseline values of the
 outcome variables.
 We estimate the following specification using Ordinary Least-Squares (OLS)
 to get the average treatment effects (ATE) of the clearinghouse intervention:

Multiple hypothesis testing
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "subsection: Multiple hypothesis testing"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because we investigate the impact channels of the clearinghouse by considering
 several possible outcomes, it is essential to account for multiple hypothesis
 testing.
 We look at treatment effects on a range of outcome measures and deal with
 multiple hypotheses testing by means of two approaches.
 One approach, followed for example by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "10.2307/2531158"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "kling2004experimental"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, is to aggregate a family of outcomes into groupings to examine whether
 there is an overall impact of the treatment.
 We use a method by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "anderson2008multiple"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and aggregate different outcomes within each domain into single summary
 indices.
 Each index is computed as a weighted mean of the standardized values of
 the outcome variables.
 The weights of this efficient generalized least squares estimator are calculate
d to maximize the amount of information captured in the index by giving
 less weight to outcomes that are highly correlated with each other.
 Combining outcomes in indices is a common strategy against over-rejection
 of the null hypothesis due to multiple inference.
 This approach is useful to see whether a particular treatment generally
 has a positive impact.
 It is for example interesting to group primary outcome variables at the
 agro-input dealer level to see if the clearinghouse treatment has a positive
 impact on dealers.
 However, interpreting these effects can be difficult.
 Furthermore, we remain interested in individual outcomes because they inform
 us about the different channels of impact.
 For example, it is interesting to see whether the seed handling practices,
 efforts and services of dealers improved at midline due to the clearinghouse,
 even though the overall index of dealer primary outcomes might not have
 significantly changed, yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we are interested in the effect of the clearinghouse on individual outcomes,
 an alternative strategy to deal with multiple comparisons is to adjust
 the significance levels according to family-wise error rates.
 Here individual coefficients are considered to be part of a family of n
 hypotheses.
 The family-wise error rate is the probability of at least one type I error
 in this family.
 We can maintain the family-wise error rate at some level alpha like 0.05
 or 0.10 by adjusting the p-values used to test each individual null hypothesis
 in the family.
 The simplest of these methods is the Bonferroni adjustment, where alpha/n
 are used as critical values.
 The downside of this method is that it assumes that outcomes are independent,
 and it often too conservative when outcomes are correlated.
 That is why we adjust while accounting for correlation, an approach used
 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "sankoh1997some"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and later by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "aker2012zap"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In this procedure the adjusted p-value depends on the number of outcomes
 being tested, the unadjusted p-value for an outcome, and the mean correlation
 among the other outcomes.
 If outcomes are independent, then the procedure is equal to the Bonferroni
 adjustment.
 If the outcomes are perfectly correlated, the adjusted p-value is equivalent
 to the unadjusted p-value.

Variable construction
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsection: Variable construction"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For continuous variables at the farmer level, 5% trimmed values are used
 to reduce the influence of outliers (2.5% trimming at each side of the distribut
ion).
 At the agro-input dealer level, we use 2% trimmed values (1% trimming at
 each side of the distribution) because there are less observations at this
 level and we do not want to loose more statistical power than necessary.
 Inverse hyperbolic sine transforms are used if skewness exceeds 1.96.
 Trimming is always done on end results.
 For instance, if the outcome is yield, then production will first be divided
 by plot area, after which inverse hyperbolic sine is taken and the end
 result is trimmed.
 Outcomes for which 95% of observations have the same value within the relevant
 sample are omitted from the analysis and not included in any indicators
 or hypothesis tests.

\begin_layout Subsection
Sample
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our sample consists of agro-input dealers and smallholder maize farmers
 who live in the catchment areas of these dealers.
 The shops are often located in towns, villages, markets, trading centers
 and other key market sheds.
 The power simulations described in subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Power-Analysis-Simulations"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 resulted in 318 dealers and 3180 households distributed over 112 catchment
 areas.
 The dealer sample was obtained by listing all agro-input shops in 11 districts
 in southeastern Uganda, which roughly corresponds to the Busoga kingdom,
 during a census.
 This resulted in 348 dealers, a sufficient sample to detect treatment effects
 according to our power simulations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the census, agro-input dealers were assigned to catchment areas.
 The definition of a catchment area can be found in subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsection: Level of randomization"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The 348 shops in Busoga were assigned to 130 catchment areas.
 1 to 18 dealers operate in an area, with a mean of 2.7.
 A computer algorithm used this list of catchment areas for the allocation
 of the treatment because randomization happened at area level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To connect agro-input shops and villages, we asked every dealer where most

.
 Then enumerators were sent to these villages and instructed to randomly
 sample ten households that meet the inclusion criteria.
 Consequently, 3470 smallholder maize farmers were sampled, sufficient to
 detect treatment effects according to our power simulations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For some outcome variables, details at the plot level are needed (e.g.
 seed spacing or rate).
 However, farmers often have more than one plot.
 As outcomes on different plots from the same farmer are likely to be strongly
 correlated, it is not cost effective to ask questions about all plots.
 An unbiased estimate of the outcome at the household level can be obtained
 by randomly selecting one plot.
 To do so, we ask enumerators to first list all plots, with names farmers
 use to refer to these plots (e.g.
 home plot, plot near the sugar cane factory).
 The Open Data Kit (ODK) program then randomly selects one plot for which
 detailed questions are asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We measure the outcomes of interest before and after the intervention, so
 that we can assess the treatment effect.
 Baseline data was collected from dealers in September and October 2020
 and from farmers in April 2021.
 Midline data was collected in January and in February 2022, and endline
 data was collected in July and August 2022.

.
 We see substantial heterogeneity among the agro-input dealers in our sample.
 Some are small informal shops which are located in rural areas and sell
 maize seed only during the planting season while they usually sell other
 products.
 Others have many customers, are efficient, located in towns and specialized
 in inputs and equipment used in agricultural production.
 The average shop was established 5 years ago and is located 7 kilometers
 from the nearest tarmac road.
 It has 3 maize varieties in stock, 41 customers per day and 21 of them
 buy maize seed.
 75% have a trading license issued by the local government, 74% are specialized
 shops which only sell farm inputs, and 44% are registered with the Uganda
 National Agro-Input and Dealers’ Association (UNADA).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When enumerators approached a shop to interview the agro-input dealer, they
 tried to talk to the person who is most knowledgeable about the day to
 day operations of the business, inventories, sales, and so on.
 The average respondent is 32 years old.
 60% are male and almost 40% finished secondary education.
 In 56% of the cases, the respondent is the owner of the shop and half of
 the respondents were trained on seed handling and storage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also collected a variety of variables related to the quality of maize
 seed sold at these agro-input shops.
 Our enumerators asked if they could check where the seed is stored and
 noted that there is quite some room for improvement.
 65% of shops have problems with pests like rats or insects, only 54% have
 a leak-proof roof, and 16% store maize seed in open containers.
 Then we asked dealers about the services they provide.
 Around half of them always recommend complementary inputs, offer extension
 or training and credit.
 On the other hand, 52% of dealers repackage seed into smaller quantities
 which often causes deterioration in quality, and 2 in 3 shops received
 a complaint about seed they sold from a customer since last season.
 We also purchased a bag of maize seed.
 Note that only 232 shops in our sample had seed in stock at the time of
 the baseline interview, hence the smaller sample size.
 We measured the moisture in the bag and found that it was 13.6% on average,
 with a minimum of 10.3 and a maximum of 17.4.
 Note that seed moisture content determines whether molds and storage pests
 thrive, so that moisture should stay below 13%.
 While 68% of seed bags show a packaging date, only 18% show an expiry date,
 8% show a certification sticker, and 3% show an indication of e-verification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Interestingly, when asked to rate the product quality of an agro-input shop
 on a scale of 1 to 5, dealers rated themselves significantly better than
 farmers did.
 It is also interesting to note that farmers who bought seed at a particular
 agro-input shop rate this shop's seed significantly worse than farmers
 who did not.
 Both comparisons can only be made for clearinghouse treated dealers and
 farmers because control dealers were not rated at baseline, and control
 farmers did not rate at baseline, hence the smaller sample size.

 When approaching the household, the enumerators were instructed to interview
 someone who is most knowledgeable about maize farming.
 However, a set of questions deals with the household head, who could be
 or could not be the respondent.
 78% the household heads in our sample are male, 51% have finished primary
 education.
 The average household head is 49 years old.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The average household started farming maize 23 years ago and has 3 acres
 of land for crop production.
 13% of farmers in our sample are members of farmer groups, associations
 or cooperatives.
 On average, 9 people belong to one household and share 3 rooms.
 The homestead of an average farmer is located 1 kilometer from the headquarters
 of the village, 4 kilometers from the nearest agro-input shop, and 9 kilometers
 from the nearest tarmac road.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Half of the farmers in our sample adopted improved maize seed on any of
 their fields last season, of these adopting farmers, 2 out of 3 bought
 this seed at an agro-input shop.
 Baseline data also shows that quality is an important factor when farmers
 decide whether and where to buy maize seed.
 When we asked farmers for the most important reason why they bought seed
 at an agro-input shop last season, seed there being of very good quality
 was the most frequent answer with 58%.
 On the other hand, when we asked farmers for the most important reason
 why they did not buy seed at an agro-input shop last season, quality concerns
 were the second most frequent answer (after the shop being too expensive).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Only 25% applied Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP) or Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and
 Potassium (NPK) on a randomly selected maize field, 7% applied Urea, and
 41% applied pesticides, herbicides or fungicides.
 Consequently, productivity is low with 500 kilograms per acre.
 Interestingly, farmers who adopted improved maize seed harvested 589 kilograms
 (worth 413 000 Ugandan shillings (UGX)) per acre on average, whereas farmers
 who did not harvested 424 kilograms (worth 299 000 UGX) per acre, meaning
 that adopting farmers had 40% more yield (worth 114 000 UGX) per acre.
 However, farmers who adopted report to have spent on average 32 000 UGX
 per acre on seed material, farmers who did not 1000 UGX per acre.
 This results in a difference of 30 000 UGX per acre in seed costs, meaning
 that adopting farmers almost quadrupled their investment.
 Half of all farmers sold some maize.
 The ones that did earned an average revenue of 313 000 UGX (80 US dollars).

Orthogonality tests of randomization balance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test if treatment and control groups are comparable in terms of a set
 of baseline characteristics, i.e.
 to test for balance at baseline, we include standard orthogonality tables
 with 40 pre-registered variables.
 Some of these characteristics are unlikely to be affected by the intervention,
 while others are picked from the primary and secondary outcomes.
 In table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "balance_farmer"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 we test balance at the level of the 
\emph on
farmer
\emph default
.
 Tests of balance at the level of the 
\emph on
agro-input dealer
\emph default
 are reported in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "balance_dealer"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sample averages with standard deviations in brackets below are reported
 in the first column.
 In the second column, we report the difference between dealers or farmers
 in catchment areas that were exposed to the clearinghouse treatment, and
 those that were not.
 When comparing these catchment areas, we find that none of the pre-registered
 baseline characteristics is significantly different between treated and
 control dealers and farmers.
 As we find no pre-treatment imbalances, we do not reject balance on any
 of the variables and conclude that the randomization was successful.

\begin_layout Standard
We see that the attrition level of dealers in the control group is higher
 than in the treatment group, whereas farmer attrition in the different
 groups seems comparable.
 If attritors and non-attritors differ significantly, this could influence
 our results.
 To learn about the dealers who left the sample, we test whether agro-input
 dealers that are not specialized were more or less likely to be attritors.
 We find that shops which do not only sell farm inputs are not significantly
 more or less likely to leave the sample.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, if the probability that a dealer left the sample is correlated
 with the clearinghouse treatment status, this could also bias our estimates.
 That is why we check how non-response is related to the treatment status.
 To be more precise, we assess the correlation between missing outcomes
 and treatment assignment using a hypothesis test and report these results
 in table

\begin_layout Standard
Whether our estimates are biased or not depends on the reason why more agro-inpu
t dealers in the clearinghouse treatment group were found than in the control
 group.
 It is for example plausible that enumerators invested less of an effort
 when searching control dealers because they did not have to deliver their
 SeedAdvisor certificates.
 Carrying this certificate might have made them more persistent when looking
 for a shop because they did not want to return to their supervisor without
 having delivered that paper.
 Moreover, the certificate might have helped the enumerators to find the
 treated dealers because they were able to show the names to neighbors etc.
 (instead of just asking) who in turn helped finding them.
 In that case, a larger number of random dealers left the control sample,
 meaning that the dealers who were not found are not different from the
 ones that were found.
 The sub-sample of dealers that remained in the control group would then
 be representative for the entire control group, hence our estimates would
 be unbiased.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, a non-random subset of agro-input dealers might have
 left our sample.
 It is for example plausible that the worst performing shops in the clearinghous
e control group went bankrupt.
 Our clearinghouse treatment might have prevented bankruptcy and helped
 dealers to stay in the market because it served as some kind of advertisement
 if the rating was good.
 Hence, as our treatment effects are positive, selection bias is most likely
 negative.

 state in their famous toolkit for using randomization in development economics
 research that in this case, when attrition bias is negative and the treatment
 effect is positive, the ordinary unadjusted estimates provide a lower bound
 for the true effect.
 In other words, selection-contaminated comparisons provide a lower bound
 on the impact of the treatment on the outcome variables 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "10.1257/aer.96.3.847"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 We could exploit statistical techniques to adjust for this.
 To construct upper bounds for treatment estimates that are robust to non-random
 attrition, we could use non-parametric approaches, for example the ones
 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "10.2307/145818"

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "NBERt0277"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The upper bound on the treatment effect can be estimated from available
 data if we make plausible assumptions about the monotonicity of outcomes
 and attrition, and relative rank restrictions on the distribution of outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, we refrain from estimating these upper 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 bounds at this point in time.
 Instead, we will increase our efforts to find every agro-input dealer at
 endline data collection.
 If a dealer is not found despite this, we will include the question why
 the dealer was not found in the ODK data collection app, and add answer
 options like shop closed, shop relocated, shop sells different products,
 dealer does not want to be interviewed, shop could not be located etc.
 If attrition remains correlated with the clearinghouse treatment at endline,
 we can use this information to check the assumptions mentioned above, and
 to eventually estimate the upper bounds.
 At this point, we do not know which dealers have left our sample, and therefore
 choose the most conservative approach, namely to look at the ordinary unadjuste
d estimates, which are lower bounds for the true effect.

 We investigate a set of primary outcomes to assess the overall impact and

 to aggregate different variables into single summary indices.
 The index of capital-intensive practices contains shop attributes which
 are associated with seed handling and storage but come along with an investment
, so that it is likely that the shop owner decides about them.
 Examples of these attributes are the quality of the roof, walls, and ventilatio
n of the shop, and whether or not there are any official inspection, training
 or registration certificates displayed in the store.
 All this was observed by our enumerators who inspected the area where seed
 was stored.
 But also questions like what is usually done with expired seed, is it for
 example sold, thrown away or mixed with other seed, are included in this
 index.
 On the other hand, the index of labor-intensive seed handling consists
 of practices that are not expensive or even for free, so that mainly the
 shop keeper has influence on them.
 Examples include whether seed is stored in a dedicated area, on an appropriate
 surface and in appropriate lighting, or in open bags or containers.
 Other variables that are not necessarily related to an investment like
 the cleanness and professionality of the shop, and whether there are problems
 with rats, insects or other pests also contribute to this index.
 The index of all seed handling practices contains both sets of variables.
 The index of efforts and services measures a range of outcomes related
 to the customer friendliness of the shop, e.g.
 whether the dealer offers explanations, recommendations, extension or training,
 discounts, credit, different payment modalities but also what the smallest
 package of seed is and a question related to customers complaints.
 The index of maize seed ratings contains the answers to the questions in
 table

, which are related to yield, drought, pest and disease tolerance, germination
 etc.
 Farmers were asked to provide these ratings, circling through all dealers
 within the relevant catchment area.
 Then these farmer ratings are aggregated at shop level (as one shop is
 rated by multiple farmers), and the index is computed.
 While most of the estimates go in the expected direction, the coefficients
 have not been estimated precisely enough to proof any significant effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the index of maize seed ratings by farmers is a pre-registered
 outcome variable but that treatment and control groups cannot be compared,
 yet.
 At baseline and midline, only clearinghouse treated farmers rated dealers
 in their proximity because being confronted with these questions is part
 of the treatment, so that the answers are only collected for households
 in treated catchment areas.
 Hence control dealers were not rated, yet, and this line is left blank.
 At endline, all farmers will rate and all shops will be rated, so that
 this variable can be investigated then.

Table

 reports the effects of the clearinghouse intervention on a set of key outcomes
 at the farmer level.
 The index of farmers' maize seed ratings for shops in their catchment area,
 our measure of product quality perception, contains the answers to the
 questions in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "questions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 as described in the previous sub-subsection.
 Here, the individual ratings are aggregated at farmer level (as one farmer
 rates multiple shops), so that the index can be computed.
 For an index of more general ratings of shops nearby, a measure of shop
 and seller perception, farmers were asked to rate shops on general quality,
 location, price, seed quality, stock, and reputation.
 Again the ratings are aggregated at farmer level.
 For the index of efforts and services provided by the dealer, farmers were
 asked whether a shop nearby offers refund or insurance if there is a problem
 with seed, credit, training or advice on how to use seed, delivery, after-sales
 service, accepts different payment methods and sells small quantities.
 The answers are aggregated at shop level and then the index is computed
 at farmer level.
 The index of farmer’s practices on a randomly selected maize field contains
 questions related to seed spacing, number of seeds, weeding, timing of
 planting, re-sowing, and the use of organic manure, DAP, NPK, Urea, pesticides,
 herbicides and fungicides etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that farmers in the treatment group are significantly more likely
 to indicate that the shop they bought maize seed from for the last season
 was not the same shop they bought seed from for the previous season(s).
 Compared to the control group, treated farmers are 5 percentage points
 more likely to have switched to a different agro-input shop.
 Note that we expected farmers to switch from low rated shops to higher
 rated shops, as illustrated in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "figure: Theory of change"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Endline data will show whether this leads to farmers purchasing better
 seed which would improve their experiences and their perception of improved
 maize seed and ultimately, adoption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the remaining primary farmer outcome variables, the effects are not
 measured precisely enough to claim any significant impact, even though
 most of them go in the expected direction.
 The index of maize seed ratings and the index of general ratings are blank
 for the reason described above.

\begin_layout Subsection
Secondary outcome variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, we investigate various pre-registered secondary outcome variables
 to explore the impact pathways in more detail and to identify steps along
 the causal chain.
 The tables of secondary outcomes are grouped by family, again for agro-input
 dealers and for farmers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Agro-input dealer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a first set of secondary outcomes at the dealer level, we construct 
\shape italic
indices
\shape default
 which aggregate different outcomes according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "anderson2008multiple"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The results are reported in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "results_dealer_sec_ind"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 These outcomes are not further adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing
 by means of an overall index because all of them are indices.
 An index of motivation and satisfaction summarizes the answers to questions
 like whether dealers see themselves working as dealers in the future, whether
 they think their jobs make a positive difference in other people's lives,
 how likely they are to recommend working as dealers, or how happy they
 feel when they come to work.
 For the index of self-ratings, dealers were asked to rate themselves on
 location, price, product quality, stock, and reputation.
 For the index of efforts and services, farmers were asked whether a shop
 offers services like refunds or credits as described above.
 Here the answers to those questions are aggregated at the dealer level
 and then the index is computed.
 To investigate changes in skills and knowledge, we construct two more indices.
 The index of knowledge particularly related to seed storage is based on
 answers to questions about seed viability, repackaging, and the optimal
 location to store seed.
 For the index of knowledge about seed, dealers were asked about the yield
 benefits of improved maize seed and which variety they would recommend
 if a farmer complains about poor soil or little rain or needs fast maturing
 seed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that farmers report that dealers in treated catchment areas invest
 significantly more effort and provide significantly better services.
 Also, given that any index ranges from minus one to one with a mean of
 zero, a coefficient of 0.23 is quite substantial.
 Note that again, this is what we predicted, see figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "figure: Theory of change"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 We expected dealers to increase their efforts due to pressure by farmers,
 their own ambitions or increased motivation.
 For the other indices, we do not find any measurable impact.

We also consider outcomes associated with particular seed types.
 The next set of variables is related to

 shows that we cannot estimate any significant effect.
 Note that these comparisons were only made if a shop stocked the particular

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also collected information related to 
\shape italic
memberships, licenses, and inspections
\shape default
.
 The clearinghouse could lead dealers to voluntarily expose themselves to
 increased scrutiny to signal farmers that they deliver quality products.
 That is why we ask whether the shop is a member of UNADA or any other professio
nal association, whether it has a trading license issued by the local government
, and some questions related to inspection.

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, enumerators purchased one random 
\shape italic
bag of maize seed
\shape default
, so that we could note a number of features and measure moisture.
 Mind that they were not able to buy seed in every shop and that the comparisons
 are made under the condition that a bag was bought.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "results_dealer_sec_bag"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 provides the results.
 We see that bags which were purchased from treated agro-input dealers are
 0.29 percentage points more likely to show a packaging date and that this
 difference is significant at the 10% level.
 This could be an indication of better quality seed in the clearinghouse
 treatment group, as seed is less likely to have been repackaged if this
 date is visible on the bag.
 The remaining coefficients are insignificant.
 Interestingly, every seed bag that was purchased at midline shows an expiry
 date, which is also why this outcome was not included in the overall index.

\begin_layout Standard
To explore impact pathways at the level of the farmer, we often look at
 outcomes at the plot level.
 To this end, farmers listed all their maize fields, and we randomly selected
 one and asked detailed questions about it.
 In table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\shape italic

\shape default
.
 The clearinghouse did not affect any variable in this family (yet).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "results_farmer_sec: plot seed"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we zoom in on the particular 
\shape italic
maize seed farmers used
\shape default
 on the randomly selected field, and investigate farmers' quality perceptions.
 For the rating index, farmers were asked to rate this seed in terms of
 general quality, yield, drought, pest and disease tolerance, early maturity,
 (output) market price and demand, price, availability, and germination
 rate.
 We see that farmers in the treatment group rate the seed they used significantl
y better, meaning that their quality perceptions changed due to the treatment.
 Note that we cannot compare farmers' ratings of the maize seed quality
 at agro-input shops (the main focus of this study and a primary outcome
 variable at dealer and farmer level), as control farmers did not rate,
 yet, because this is part of the treatment.
 Considering that 42% of the seed farmers used on the random field was bought
 at an agro-input shop, see table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "results_farmer_sec: plot adoption"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, this coefficient could be an indication that farmers' perception of seed
 at shops also changed due to the clearinghouse treatment.
 When we have collected the ratings from the entire sample at endline, we
 will be able to see whether this is in fact the case.
 All coefficients in this table go into the expected direction, so that
 also the overall index computed according to

 Looking at skills and knowledge, this index is computed by means of questions
 asking about seed handling and management when using improved quality maize
 seed, including questions about weeding, fertilizer application, the best

 However, these questions are only asked in the endline questionnaire to

Specialized agro-input shops
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we asked agro-input dealers during baseline data collection whether
 their shop only sells farm inputs, 74% answered with yes, while 26% reported
 to also sell other products.
 The results of rerunning the analysis for specialized shops only can be
 found in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "results_dealer_prim_het1"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Treated specialized shops earn significantly more revenue from selling
 maize seed than specialized shops in the control group, whereas we previously
 did not find any treatment effect on primary outcomes at dealer level.
 Revenue could have increased because the clearinghouse's effect on efforts
 and services is larger for this subset of dealers.
 For these specialized shops, the treatment also reduced the shelf-life
 of stored seed (measured as the number of days between the packaging date
 and the enumerator's seed purchase or, if this date is not visible on the
 bag, the expiry date minus six months) significantly.
 A maize seed bag's shelf-life is an important indication of its quality.
 Treated specialized dealers stock seed which is on average 79 days younger
 than seed stocked by control dealers, while the mean is 150 days.
 Treated specialized dealers also sell significantly more Longe 10H.
 All this could explain why specialized shops in treated catchment areas
 enjoy a higher revenue than specialized shops in control areas and indicates
 that the clearinghouse has a stronger impact on specialized agro-input
 dealers.
 An explanation could be that dealers who only sell inputs and equipment
 used in agricultural production take the maize seed ratings more serious
 because they concern their only business, while shops which also sell other
 products are less endangered if some maize seed customers are not satisfied
 with their product quality.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
More competitive catchment areas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The full sample contains 46 catchment areas with only one dealer.
 Excluding these smallest clusters leaves us with 302 shops and 3020 farmers
 in 84 areas.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "results_farmer_het2"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 reports that within this subset of more competitive areas, the clearinghouse
 has a slightly larger effect on the switching of farmers to different agro-inpu
t shops.
 According to farmers, the difference in efforts and services between treatment
 and control group is larger in these areas and significant at the 1% level.
 For areas with more than one dealer, the difference in likelihood of packaging
 dates being visible on maize seed bags is also larger than for the full
 sample.
 Together, this could indicate that the clearinghouse works better in areas
 with several shops and that our results for the full sample are driven
 by these dealers.
 This stands to reason because in areas with only one shop, it is less easy
 for farmers to switch and dealers could be less inclined to increase their
 efforts if there is no threat of competition nearby.
 At the farmer level, the coefficient for the quality ratings for seed used
 on the randomly selected maize field is smaller and insignificant here.

Similarly, we investigate what happens if we exclude areas with more than

 Note that excluding these largest clusters could improve statistical power,
 even though it implies throwing away sample

.
 We drop three catchment areas which leads to a subset of 303 dealers and
 3020 farmers in 127 areas, and repeat the analysis.
 The coefficient for farmers switching to different agro-input shops remains
 very similar, meaning that the results for the entire sample are not driven
 by these larger areas.
 The impact of the clearinghouse on dealers' efforts and services and the
 likelihood that a seed bag shows the packaging date are weaker, indicating
 that the dealers in the largest areas increased their efforts in response
 to the treatment more than other dealers.
 On the other hand, the quality ratings of seed used on the randomly selected
 maize field are stronger in this subgroup without the most competitive
 areas.

Shops that were rated
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the first round, 8% of dealers in the clearinghouse treatment group were
 not rated by a single of farmer, so we exclude them and rerun the analysis.
 For this sub-sample, the difference between treated and control dealers
 in terms of efforts and services is larger and significant at the 1% level.
 As shown in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, we also find a significant impact on the overall index summarizing variables
 related to the bag of maize seed.
 This result is driven by the shelf-life variable, an important indication
 of seed quality.
 In conclusion, the impact of the clearinghouse seems stronger for shops
 that were actually rated.
 This implies that the treatment effect is smaller for dealers who were
 supposed to be but not actually treated, which is what one would expect.

\begin_layout Standard
When farmers were asked why they bought maize seed at a particular agro-input
 shop, a couple of clearinghouse treated farmers named the shop's high SeedAdvis
or rating as the most important reason during the midline interview.
 The results show that several outcome variables change in response to the
 clearinghouse treatment, and behave the way the theory of change in figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "figure: Theory of change"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 predicted.
 These changes, even though often not robust to multiple hypothesis testing,
 can be interpreted as first indications of an impact.
 Note that the reported unadjusted estimates are conservative lower bounds
 for the true effect as attrition bias is negative and the treatment effect
 is positive.
 Also note that at this point in time, ratings have been disseminated only
 once, and that changing farmer and dealer behavior is likely to take some
 time.
 If the clearinghouse triggers farmers to choose better dealers and dealers
 to increase their efforts, so that farmers purchase better seed, then it
 still takes another agricultural season for farmers to have better experiences,
 perceive seed to be better and ultimately increase improved maize seed
 adoption.
 Endline data will show whether the clearinghouse has a substantial impact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the objective of the clearinghouse is to make maize seed quality
 observable, its functioning could be endangered if farmers' ratings do
 not actually measure seed quality but for example the personal relationship
 between a farmer and a dealer.
 That is why we test whether the ratings are correlated with seed quality.
 Even though objectively measuring seed quality is challenging and DNA fingerpri
nting is the only reliable way to detect varietal purity, we were able to
 check whether ratings are correlated with other objective indications of
 seed quality.
 Note that this was only done for treated shops because control shops had
 not been rated at baseline, yet.
 We find that specialized agro-input shops which only sell farm inputs have
 higher ratings.
 The index of capital-intensive seed handling and storage practices is also
 positively correlated with the rating.
 Dealers who did not receive any complaint about seed they sold from a customer
 since last season have higher ratings than dealers who did.
 Furthermore, farmers did not only rate the seed of agro-input shops but
 also the seed they used on a randomly selected maize field, using the same
 questions.
 We find that an index of these seed ratings is positively correlated with
 the farmer's yield.
 All this shows that the clearinghouse ratings do measure maize seed quality
 to some extend.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another danger to the functioning of the clearinghouse could be agro-input
 dealers who start to influence ratings in a dishonest manner, for example
 by faking ratings or by bribing farmers.
 Note that during this trial, rating and rated participants were connected
 by asking dealers where their customers come from, and collecting ratings
 from ten random farmers in that village.
 Dealers would need to understand our experimental design in order to know
 which farmer they would need to influence.
 That is why it is almost impossible that dealers cheat during this trial.
 However, if the clearinghouse intervention would be scaled up, these kind
 of challenges would need to be addressed.
 However, the objective of this paper is to test whether a prediction of
 the theory occurs in practice, namely whether making seed quality observable
 improves quality and ultimately adoption, and not to provide a policy intervent
ion, sophisticated enough to be applied without further considerations.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though agricultural technologies like high yielding seed varieties
 and fertilizers are seen as the key to agricultural productivity, smallholder
 farmers in sub-Saharan Africa do not sufficiently adopt them, which hinders
 poverty alleviation at the individual and aggregate level.
 We study a particular constraint to technology adoption: the perceived
 quality of agricultural inputs like improved maize seed.
 We hypothesize that the intentional and unintentional malpractices of agro-inpu
t dealers lead to poor seed quality, resulting in under-adoption by smallholder
 farmers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To assess the importance of this potential constraint to agricultural technology
 adoption, we test an intervention which reduces the information asymmetry
 between seller and buyer by making the quality of maize seed observable.
 To this end, we implement an information clearinghouse that is based on
 crowd-sourced ratings in the market for seed.
 This clearinghouse is tested in a randomized controlled trial among 350
 agro-input dealers and 3500 smallholder maize farmers in Uganda.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis of midline data shows first indications of an impact.
 Heterogeneity analysis suggests that the information clearinghouse works
 better for agro-input dealers who only sell farm inputs and who were actually
 rated by farmers.
 The intervention also has a larger effect in areas with more competition.
 However, endline data has to be analyzed before we can draw final conclusions.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We investigate both outcomes at the input dealer level and at the farmer
 level.
 We analyze power at the input dealer level first and consider two outcome
 variables: (i) the quantity of seed sold by the input dealer in the last
 season, and (ii) the reputation of the input dealer.
 The quantity of seed that the input dealer sold is a continuous variable
 (kilogram) with mean 325 and standard deviation 454.
 For the reputation outcome variable, farmers rate the input dealers in
 their catchment areas on a scale from 1 to 5.
 A dealer's reputation is then calculated as the average of those ratings
 and treated as a continuous variable.
 The mean reputation of seed of an input dealer in the sample is 3.68 and
 the standard deviation is 0.61.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also need to assume a treatment effect size for the interventions that
 will be implemented at the catchment area level.
 As we did not immediately find credible studies that evaluated the impact
 of catchment area level interventions on quantity sold nor reputation,
 we decided to define expected treatment effect size in terms of Cohen's
 d, settling for a size that is between small and medium, of 0.35 times the
 standard deviation.
 For quantity sold, this means 159 kilogram, while for reputation the minimal
 detectable effect size becomes 0.21.

\begin_layout Standard
Figure

 looks at power levels for different sample sizes (in terms of number of
 catchment areas included in the study) to detect an increase of 159 kilogram
 of improved seed sold by the input dealer at the 5% significance level.
 If the number of catchment areas is larger than 93, we hit the 80% power
 threshold.
 These 93 catchment areas correspond to about 263 input dealers.

The last outcome we consider in our power analysis is the quality of seed
 assessed by farmers.
 The initial quality rating from 1 to 5 is transformed into a binary variable

 We assume a small effect in terms of Cohen’s d (0.2 times the standard deviation
 or 0.088 percentage points).
 Given this assumption, figure

 found.
 Ideally, the total number of farmers that need to be included in the study
 is thus 4,770.
 However, finding impact on yields is hard, as this is an outcome that is
 pretty far down the causal impact chain.
 Yields also show high variability.
 Finally, our project is mainly concerned with increasing seed quality as
 an intermediary to increase yield.
 As such, more direct outcomes such as input use and quality are of primary
 interest.
 Further considering financial constraints and logistics, we decided to
 collect information on 10 farmers per input dealer, leading to a sample
 size of 3,200 households.
 Our expected sample sizes are therefore 318 input dealers and 3,200 households.
 We will collect more data to account for attrition.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our factorial design deviates from commonly used factorial designs in that
 the experimental unit differs depending on the factor.
 For the first two factors, corresponding to the information clearinghouse
 and the input-dealer training, randomization happens at the level of the
 catchment area.
 For the third factor that addresses learning failures of farmers, randomization
 happens at the level of the village.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The main motivation to randomize at the village level is to eliminate potential
 spillover effects for the third treatment.
 However, as we will discuss later, we make sure there is correspondence
 between villages and input dealers, which would allow us to also look at
 the impact of the farmer training treatment on outcomes at the input dealer
 level.
 However, at that level, spillovers may affect results.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The resulting layout, with sample sizes indicated in each treatment cell
 is illustrated in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Design"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The first two interventions are implemented at the catchment area level.
 A total of 130 catchment areas are included in the study.
 Half of these are randomly allocated to the first treatment: all input
 dealers in 66 catchment areas receive the input dealer training, while
 input dealers in the remaining 64 catchment areas function as the control
 for this treatment.
 This corresponds to 166 and 182 input dealers in these treatment arms.
 Orthogonal to the first factor, the second factor is placed, corresponding
 to the second treatment that is also implemented at the catchment area
 level.
 Also here, in half of the 130 catchment areas an information clearinghouse
 was implemented, and half of the catchment areas function as a control
 for this treatment.
 However, this is done in such a way that balance with respect to the first
 treatment exists in both treatment and control groups for the second treatment.
 This means that the treatment group of the second treatment consists of
 33 catchment areas that received the first treatment and 32 catchment areas
 that function as the control for the first treatment.
 Similarly, for the control catchment areas for the second treatment, 33
 are catchment areas where input dealers received the input dealer training
 and 32 catchment areas where input dealers did not get trained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the third treatment is implemented at the level of the village, it
 is also important to preserve balance in the orthogonal factors.
 In other words, we need to make sure that an equal number of villages that
 are assigned to receive a treatment against learning failures are drawn
 from catchment areas where input dealers received training as from catchment
 areas where the input dealer training did not take place.
 Similarly, orthogonality should also be maintained for the second treatment.
 Therefore, in each of the four treatment cells formed by interacting the
 first two treatments, 175 villages were randomly assigned to the third
 treatment while another 173 villages were assigned to the control.

 The transformed amount of Longe 10H lost or wasted last season (IHS) is

 The number of times the shop ran out of Longe 10H last season is not included
 because the impact of the treatments on this outcome is ambiguous (increased
 adoption could e.g.
 increase demand and hence this number but dealers could also take better

 Furthermore, this number mostly depends on parameters further up the value
