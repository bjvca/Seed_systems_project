Overcoming lemon technologies: Can a crowd-sourced information clearinghouse
 save the Ugandan market for seed?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Agricultural technology remains under-adopted among smallholder farmers
 in Sub-Saharan Africa.
 We investigate how the quality of an agricultural technology affects its
 adoption.
 As improved maize seed quality is easier to observe by sellers than by
 buyers, we hypothesize that this information asymmetry leads to poor seed
 quality offered by agro-input dealers, resulting in under-adoption by farmers.
 To overcome this classic lemons technology problem, we implement a crowd-source
d information clearinghouse similar to yelp.com in the market for seed.
 This intervention is tested in a randomized controlled trial among 350
 agro-input dealers and 3500 smallholder farmers in Uganda.

Our study will test an intervention aimed at identifying the relative importance

Background

\begin_layout Subsection
The context
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the most effective ways to increase agricultural productivity is
 through the adoption of improved agricultural technologies and practices.
 These include mechanization, but the Green Revolution has demonstrated
 that large gains can also be expected from improved inputs such as inorganic
 fertilizers and high yielding cultivars.
 However, technology adoption remains below optimum, particularly among
 the poor in sub-Saharan Africa 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gollin2005technology"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 As a result, differences in yields between sub-Saharan Africa and areas
 that experienced a Green Revolution have nearly doubled since 1961 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "magruder2018assessment"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 To reduce this yield gap, it is important to identify the drivers of, and
 constraints to, technology adoption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In line with the general trend in economics, the drivers and constraints
 of agricultural technology adoption have increasingly been studied using
 field experiments 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 For instance, the Agricultural Technology Adoption Initiative (ATAI), a
 collaboration between MIT's Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL)
 and UC Berkeley's Center for Effective Global Action (CEGA) has funded
 a series of field experiments to illuminate what helps and hinders technology
 adoption among smallholder farmers.
 Identified key constraints include poor access to information

 We specifically explore (perceived) quality of improved maize seed as a
 constraint to its adoption among a sample of smallholder maize farmers
 in Uganda.
 Maize is an important crop there, both for home consumption and as a source
 of income.
 While improved maize seeds are adopted to some extent, various factors
 constrain the further development and sustainability of an efficient Ugandan
 seed system.
 Recent studies argue that smallholder adoption of improved inputs in Uganda,
 and of improved maize seed in particular, is limited by farmers’ beliefs
 that the inputs are of poor quality - counterfeited, adulterated, or otherwise
 non-performant 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because agricultural input quality is hardly observable, information asymmetries
 between sellers and buyers characterize the markets for seed and fetilizer.
 As argued in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bold2017lemon"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the Ugandan market for improved maize seed appears similar to the market
 for used cars described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "george1970market"
literal "false"

\end_inset

’s classic study 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyearpar
key "george1970market"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 In such a market where the quality is known by the seller, but not (yet)
 by the buyer, the quality of products can degrade.
 Here, smallholder farmers can hardly assess the quality of agricultural
 inputs prior to purchase.
 Agro-input dealers who sell these inputs to farmers may exploit this informatio
n assymetry, and their malpractices may lead to poor seed quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
hypthesis: The malpractices of agro-input dealers lead to poor agricultural
 input quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These malpractices may on the one hand be intentional.
 Dealers may sacrifice quality to increase profits, for instance by mixing
 good quality seed with poor quality seed to cut costs.
 There are indications of this kind of adulteration at some point in the
 Ugandan input value chain.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 find that hybrid maize seed contains less than 50% authentic seed, while

\end_inset

 find that nearly one in three bottles of herbicide contains less than 75%
 of the labeled concentration of the active ingredient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, these malpractices may be unintentional.
 Poor handling and storage at the level of the agro-input dealer may lead
 to seed quality deterioration.
 The dealer may not be aware and thus sell seed of inferior quality without
 intending to do so.
 There is also some evidence of this kind of quality reduction.
 In a comprehensive study of the Ugandan seed supply chain, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "BARRIGA2020104928"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 document various issues related to handling and storage that may reduce
 the quality of this input.
 For example, smallholder farmers often need smaller quantities than what
 is packaged in standard bags, and dealers thus often repackage in sub-optimal
 environments.
 Poor rotation of seed stock and storage in open bags, in moist conditions
 or in direct sunlight also reduce seed quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These intentional and unintentional malpractices at the agro-input dealer
 level may lead to poor agricultural input quality.
 Purchasing poor inputs will lead to disappointing experiences at the farmer
 level.
 As a result, farmers' future willingness to pay and their seed adoption
 is low.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
hypthesis: Smallholder farmers under-adopt agricultural inputs because they
 perceive the quality of these inputs sold at agro-input dealers to be poor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The potential solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This problem can be solved by reducing information asymmetries between the
 two parties.
 While Uganda does regulate seed quality through seed certification processes
 and standards, this mechanism provides farmers with a relatively weak and
 unreliable indication of quality.
 Alternative mechanisms such as electronic verification systems have also
 been experimented with, but the cost of implementation has proven challenging,
 and they depend on the reliability of the underlying seed certification
 system.
 In our study, we will test an alternative, decentralized clearinghouse
 that is based on crowd-sourced information and works through reputational
 mechanisms, much like yelp.com or tripadvisor.com.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Information clearinghouse mechanisms have been studied to some extent, but
 mostly to address market price information asymmetries between smallholder
 farmers and middlemen.
 Assuming that middlemen are better informed about prevailing prices in
 the market than farmers, theory suggests that providing farmers with price
 information increases their bargaining power.
 However, evidence is mixed: while 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "10.2307/25760218"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 finds that internet kiosks that provided wholesale price information significan
tly increased soy prices in India, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "fafchamps2012impact"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 do not find a statistically significant effect of market information delivered
 to farmers' mobile phones by a commercial service called Reuters Market
 Light (RML) in a neighboring state.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A clearinghouse that relies on crowd-sourced ratings may be more effective
 to increase seed quality in the market.
 While prices can generally be observed reasonably easy, assessing an experience
 good such as seed is much harder.
 At the time of purchase, visual seed inspection is limited to seed purity
 and the presence of mold.
 Germination can only be assessed after planting.
 Some seed may also be more susceptible to pests and diseases, so the overall
 quality of seed can only be judged after harvest.
 Aggregation of the experiences of many users may thus be a particular powerful
 way to reveal the quality of the product.
 And mind that a clearinghouse may affect both intentional and non-intentional
 quality reductions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The study by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hasanain2019no"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, who set up a rating system for public veterinary services in Pakistan,
 is probably the closest to ours.
 They find that farmers who use the clearinghouse enjoy a 25 percent higher
 success rate of artificial insemination.
 Their research suggests that this is mostly due to increased veterinarian
 effort, as few farmers seem to be switching from veterinaries that receive
 poor ratings to veterinaries that receive good ratings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hence a crowd-sourced information clearinghouse can be an important institutiona
l innovation to solve the problem of asymmetric information in the market
 for agricultural inputs.
 It may be preferable to alternative strategies such as regulating quality
 due to its likely lower cost, self-sustaining nature and scaleability,
 and helps to overcome problems such as insufficient public investment in
 regulatory systems, regulatory enforcement, and market surveillance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
hypthesis: An information clearinghouse reduces malpractices at the agro-input
 dealer level and in turn improves smallholder farmers' perception and adoption
 of agricultural inputs.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An information clearinghouse may work through different impact pathways.
 Firstly, farmers who did not buy (or who bought only a little) seed before
 may start adopting (or adopting more) improved seed when they realize that
 an agro-input dealer in their vicinity has a good rating, meaning that
 the quality of the seed sold there is better than expected.
 Secondly, farmers may switch from low rated dealers to higher rated dealers
 after learning that their usually chosen agro-input dealer received a poor
 rating.
 Alternatively, farmers may pressure their usual dealers to increase their
 efforts.
 Dealers could also start improving on their own (ie.
 without the pressure of farmers) after they have learned that their seed
 quality is rated poorly and want to improve their products.
 Lastly, dealers could also increase their efforts after seeing that they
 were rated well and feel motivated and satisfied due to this reward.
 All these scenarios lead to seed of better quality, farmers purchasing
 better seed which improves their experiences by reducing risk and increasing
 profitability and later their perception of seed.
 Ultimately, this is expected to lead to increased adoption of improved
 seed.

Level of randomization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Ethics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because randomizing our intervention at the level of the agro-input dealer
 prompted ethical concerns, we randomized at the level of the catchment
 area.
 Often, dealers are clustered in markets or trading centers.
 Two or more agro-input dealers may operate in the same neighborhood, or
 in the same street or even right next to each other.
 One dealer may get assigned to the clearinghouse treatment group and receives
 a good rating, while his/her neighbor gets assigned to the clearinghouse
 control group and does not get the chance to receive any rating.
 Farmers may prefer the dealer with the rating, even though the seed quality
 of the control dealer may be the same or even better.
 The rating would in this case lead to a competitive advantage for the treated
 dealer, but the reverse may be also true if the treated dealer gets a poor
 rating.
 Randomizing at area level reduces the risk of harming someone with our
 experiement.
 As it is important to think about the ethics of experimentation, especially
 when the participants are vulnerable 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, we opted to be more ethical at the expense of statistical power.

training: While this is less of a concern for the first treatment, we were
 still worried that providing an intense training treatment to one input
 dealer but not to his or her immediate neighbor may be difficult in practice.
 So also for this treatment, catchment areas will be targeted.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another benefit of randomizing at catchment area level is that it allows
 us to measure the effect of the clearinghouse at the level of the dealer
 and at the level of the farmer.
 If we would randomize at dealer level, one dealer may be rated but his/her
 neighbor may not.
 If we want to know if the clearinghouse leads to increased adoption of
 improved maize seed among farmers, we need to be able to connect each farmer
 unambiguously to treatment ot control, hence to a single dealer.
 We avoid this by randomizing at the catchment area level because then all
 dealers within that area were rated (or not) and all farmers within that
 area are potential customers of only dealers who were (or not).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Definition of a catchment area
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A catchment area is defined as an area that is served by an agro-input dealer,
 as the area where this dealer's customers live.
 If catchment areas of two or more dealers overlap because these dealers
 operate in the same town, street or right next to each other.
 Assignment of the input dealers to catchment areas is done on the basis
 of geographical location.
 Using GPS coordinates of the input dealers, the halversine function is
 used to construct an adjacency matrix, and input dealers that are less
 than 5 kilometer apart are grouped into a single catchment area.
 The 5 kilometer threshold was selected based on visual inspection of the
 map, the size of an average village and reported distance between farmers
 and input dealers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Factorial design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The information clearinghouse is part of a larger project which evaluates
 the effects of different interventions.
 In this field experiment, various treatment and control groups are randomly
 assigned to different combinations of treatment or control conditions.
 The randomized control trial (RCT) took the form of a 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{3}$
\end_inset

 factorial design because we tested the impact of three interventions.
 To test the hypotheses above, a rating system was set up among a random
 sub-sample of catchment areas of input dealers, and farmer and input dealers
 will receive feedback on the ratings.
 The other two interventions are not of interest for this paper.
 
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Standard
Factorial designs allow recycling of treated units in the orthogonal factor

 As such, to estimate main effects, less observations are needed than would

 Simulation, where the experiment is run thousands of times and one simply
 counts how frequently the treatment comes up significant, provides a flexible
 and intuitive way to analyze power.
 Furthermore, instead of relying on a theoretical distribution for the outcome
 variables that takes assumptions and returns an analytic solution, simulations
 can sample from real data.
 In our case, we use survey data from about 80 input dealers that were collected
 in three districts in eastern Uganda in July 2019.
 Furthermore, we surveyed 1,500 farmers in the catchment areas of these
 80 input dealers

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will analyze power both outcomes at the input dealer level and at the
 farmer level.
 The appedix contains more info on which outcome variables are considered
 and which treatment effect sizes are assumed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To determine sample size (defined in terms of the number of catchment areas
 for the first two treatments), the algorithm iterates over different candidate
 sample sizes (eg.
 from 75 catchment areas up to 125 catchment areas with increments of 5
 catchment areas).
 For each candidate sample size, a random sample with replacement is drawn
 from the survey data.
 This sample is then used to run a number (eg.
 1000) of simulations of the experiment.
 In particular, for each simulation, all input dealers that are in half
 of the catchment areas are assigned to the treatment condition and the
 other half to the control condition.
 To the outcomes of interest that are assigned to the treatment condition,
 the assumed effect is added and the analysis is conducted.
 In our case, we are interested in the average treatment effect, so we simply
 regress the outcome on a treatment indicator and record if the coefficient
 on the treatment indicator is significant at the 5 percent level.
 Finally, we determine how often, out of the total number of simulations,
 we were able to detect the effect at the 5 percent significance level.
 This will give us the power associated with that particular candidate sample
 size.
 Power can then be plotted against sample size to obtain power curves as
 is shown in detail in the appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec: Details about power analysis simulations"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once we have decided how many catchment areas (and associated input dealers)
 are necessary to detect effects at the level of the input dealer, we need
 to determine how many farmers we need to sample from these catchment areas
 to identify impact of the interventions on that level.
 To make sure we have sufficient farmers to rate each input dealer, we will
 allocate a fixed number of farmers to each input dealer.
 This may mean that we have slightly differing numbers of farmers in the
 different treatment groups, as the randomization happened at the catchment
 area.
 While this may reduce power somewhat, this does not bias impact estimates.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We again use simulation to determine the number of farmers per input dealer.
 When we determined the minimum number of catchment areas (and corresponding
 input dealers), we fix the number of catchment areas at this number.
 We then iterate over different candidate sample sizes of farmers per input
 dealer (ranging from only one farmer per input dealer, which would lead
 to a total sample the same numer of farmers as of dealers, to 25 farmers
 per input dealer, which would lead to a sample size of many more farmers
 than dealers).
 The resulting sample in each iterations is used to run a number (eg.
 1000) of simulations of the experiment.
 For each simulation, all farmers that are in the catchment area of input
 dealers that are in half of the catchment areas are assigned to the treatment
 condition and all other farmers are assigned to the control condition.
 To the farmer level outcomes of interest that are assigned to the treatment
 condition in this way, the assumed effect is added and the analysis is
 conducted.
 We again determine how often, out of the total number of simulations, we
 were able to detect the effect at the 5 percent significance level, which
 will give us the power associated to that iteration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that if the number of catchment areas is larger than 112, our experiment
s will return statistically significant results 80 percent of the time.
 This corresponds to about 318 input dealers.
 Based on further simulations, we decided to collect information on 10 farmers
 per input dealer, leading to a sample size of 3,200 households.
 Our expected sample sizes are therefore 318 input dealers and 3,200 households.
 We will collect more data to account for attrition.

), we asked farmers to rate dealers in their catchment area on a number
 of characteristics.
 To ensure that farmers knew exactly which dealer they were rating, we used
 the name of the shop and the dealer, the nicknames and other names under
 which they may be known in the community (e.g.
 son of ...).
 Furthermore, we mentioned the name of the market, a description of the
 place and added a picture of the shop which was collected during our census

 Farmers were able to assess these seed quality attributes based on observing
 germination and yields, the resistance of the seeds against pests etc.
 The questions are carefully formulated and include "as advertised" because
 not every improved maize seed variety is eg.
 drought tolerant, ie.
 some of these seed attributes are not quality dimensions of every seed
 variety.
 That is why no dealer should be punished for selling seed that is not drought
 tolerant unless he or she is intransparent about this or even uses deceptive
 marketing practices.
 Note that all questions deal with seed quality, not with other attributes
 that could distinguish good from bad dealers like their prices or services
 (e.g.
 whether or not a dealer offers seed on credit or advice).
 The aim of the clearinghouse rating it to make unobservable seed quality
 observable.

\begin_layout Subsection
Computation of ratings 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the responses of all farmers in the catchment area, we computed
 the ratings for each agro-input dealer.
 These ratings were translated into words and stars, so that they are easily
 understandable for farmers and dealers who are not used to interpreting
 numbers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
What to do if a treated dealer does not receive a single rating?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a dealer in a treated catchment area is not rated by a single farmer
 eg.
 because no farmer knew him/her, we could act as if data were missing and
 fill in the catchment area mean as his/her rating.
 However, this is not as innocent as it seems because it is likely that
 missingness is not random.
 Poor quality dealers have less customers, so their likelihood to get rated
 is lower.
 Giving them average catchment area ratings inflates the ratings of these
 low quality dealers.
 Instead, we simply told farmers that we do not have information about this
 dealer (implicitly informing the farmer that the dealer exists), see also
 table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "SMS"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Should more ratings lead to better ratings?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If dealer A is rated by 10 farmers and gets rating 3,5 and dealer B is rated
 by 1 farmer and gets rating 3,6, we treat dealer B as the better dealer.
 Even though getting many (few) farmer ratings might be due to good (poor)
 quality (missingness might not be random, see precious paragraph), there
 might be other reasons why dealers are rated by many (few) farmers.
 Also on TripAdvisor, having more reviews than a rival hotel does not guarantee
 a higher ranking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Should ratings depend on catchment area dealer performance?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following shows that ratings should not depend on catchment area averages.
 In an area with poor quality dealers in which one dealer is a bit better
 than the rest but still poor, we do not want this dealer to be rated well
 (ie.
 expose farmers to poor quality dealers).
 Similarly, in an area with good dealers in which one dealer is a bit worse
 than the rest but still good, we do not want this dealer to be rated poorly
 (which would be unfair towards him/her).
 On the other hand, only 9% of dealers received a rating below 3 out of
 5, so we would throw away valuable data if we would only disseminate good
 scores without any variation.
 Therefore, we take the distribution of ratings into account by using quintiles.
 Consequently, less dealers got rating 4 or 5, more dealers got rating 3.
 This could strengthen the effect of the treatment on dealer effort.
 If dealers get rating 3 instead of 4 or 5, they could be more inclined
 to improve their scores.
 Consequently, also the effect on seed quality itself could be larger.
 However, the clearinghouse should also have a signaling effect, which might
 be weaker if more dealers are rated 3 than rated 4 or 5 (dealers seem to
 be of worse quality to farmers).
 Therefore, we chose names of the quintiles with a positive connotation
 during rating dissemination: as most dealers received a good or very good
 rating before taking the distribution into account, we ensure that even
 a 3 is still communicated as "good" to farmers to not weaken the signaling
 effect and because of the distribution of the original ratings, we intend
 to disseminate ratings as truthfully, purely and as closely to reality
 as possible.
 That is why the first quintile is translated to "okay" and gets one star,
 the second one is named "good" and receives two stars, the third quintile
 is "very good" and gets three stars, the fourth and fifth one are "excellent"
 and awarded with four and five stars.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Are female dealers rated worse than male dealers?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because 41% of agro-input dealers in our sample are female and women could
 be rated more negatively, we also tested whether there are significant
 differences between the ratings of female dealers and the ratings of male
 dealers.
 We controlled for some potentially confounding variables, like age, education
 level, distances to the nearest tarmac and murram roads (as measures of
 remoteness) and additionally for many indications of quality (whether the
 shop only sells farm inputs, years since shop establishment, questions
 related the quality of the shop's roof, walls, ventilation, floor, lighting
 and seed storage, questions related to rats/pests, official certificates,
 cleanness and professionality, customer complaints, and temperature).
 Because we found a significant difference in ratings (Pr(>|t|) < 0.1) after
 controlling for all this, we have no reason to believe that this difference
 can be explained by real quality differences.
 Hence there is no other reason than discrimination for female dealers to
 be rated worse.
 Therefore, we adjusted the ratings of female dealers accordingly to prevent
 this kind of discrimination.
 Otherwise female dealers could be harmed by our intervention.
 We changed the ratings of all female dealers by adding the coefficients
 of the gender dummy to the initial ratings.
 This means that we regressed all seed quality attributes on the gender
 dummy and add the resulting coefficients to these individual ratings.
 Then we did the same with the mean (summary) rating.

\begin_layout Standard
The first rating dissemination, ie.
 the first distribution of agro-input dealer ratings to farmers and dealers,
 happened in July and August 2021 because farmers started buying seed for
 the next agricultural season in August.
 In the treated catchment areas, farmers were provided with the ratings
 of all dealers in their proximity.
 Due to the pandemic and a Ugandan lockdown from June 18 until July 30 2021,
 our project faced a lot of uncertainty, especially because farmers and
 dealers needed to be treated before the second agricultural season of 2021.
 To ensure that farmers received the necessary information before buying
 seed, we sent them one SMS per dealer in their catchment area in the beginning
 of July 2021, see figure

.
 This text message was translated into three local languages - Lusoga, Lugwere,
 Samia - choosen at the sub-county level (87 sub-counties) to increase specifici
ty.
 Also in the control catchment areas, farmers received an SMS with all dealer
 names in their proximity, so that they were aware of the presence of these
 dealers.
 This could enable us to seperate the "knowledge effect" (farmers knowing
 which dealers operate in their proximity) from the clearinghouse effect
 (making unobservable seed quality observable).
 This approach is also double-blind: control farmers believe that they are
 treated which is important

For the success of the clearinghouse treatment it was crucial to disseminate
 the ratings to farmers before they started buying seed, so that they could
 use that information when chosing where to purchase inputs.
 That is why we had to visit them before mid-August
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the second agricultural season of 2021, farmers started buying seed later
 than usual.
 That is due to delayed rains in the first agricultural season which delayed
 they planting then.
 Hence few farmers harvested as usual in July 2021 while most waited for
 maturity and harvested maize between mid-July and early August.
 Farmers cannot start planting until the crop from the previous season is
 harvested.
 Besides, they need to sell some of the harvested maize to raise money for
 buying seed.
 Therefore, second season planting only took place in between mid-August
 and early September.
 That is why farmers bought seed later than usual.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Luckily Ugandan regulations allowed us to go to the field immediately after
 the lockdown ended on July 30.
 Our enumerators re-visited all (treatment and control) farmers in the first
 half of August 2021 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

) and farmers were treated as initially planned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this purpose, we designed a visually appealing dissemination app which
 cycles through all dealers in the catchment area of each farmer.
 Again, to ensure that farmers could identify the dealer in question, we
 used the shop and owner names, nicknames and alternative names, location,
 a description and a photo of the shop.
 In the version designed for clearinghouse treated farmers, the cycling
 through dealers starts with the dealer with the highest rating.
 We used passive voice and coverted ratings into words and stars: "We wanted
 to let you know that customers from input dealer x rate the quality of
 maize seed sold there as okay/good/very good/excellent! The quality of
 the maize seed that this agro-input shop sells got a score of 1/2/3/4/5
 out of 5!".
 Then the enumerator showed the stars after showing the photo of the shop
 again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To ensure that control farmers were also aware of the existence of dealers
 in their proximity (to seperate the "knowledge effect" from the clearinghouse
 effect, see above in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) we also cycled through all dealers in control areas and asked a couple
 of questions e.g.
 "Do you know the agro-input shop called x?" (similar to the rating collection
 during baseline data collection but with less questions).
 This led control farmers to believe that they were treated, which is of
 importance

\begin_layout Subsection
Dissemination of ratings to dealers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Agro-input dealers received their own general and specific ratings by means
 of a report on paper.
 It was delivered to the shops in July 2021, see figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "timeline"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The front showed a visually appealing certificate with a logo and the own
 general rating: "Input dealer x scores y out of 5.
 This was based on z reviews.
 This score means that farmers in the area think that the quality of the
 maize seed this shop sells is: okay/good/very good/excellent.
 SeedAdvisor certicate 2021." Scores, words and stars matched those disseminated
 to farmers (see above).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The back of the paper report showed an explanation and more detailed information.
 In addition to the dealer's general rating, it shows the dealer's specific
 ratings (overall quality, yield, drought and disease resistance, speed
 of maturing, and germination) and the average ratings of other agro-input
 dealers in the same catchment area in a table, visualized by stars.
 This shows dealers their relative position in the area and might stimulate
 competition.
 Dealers were not informed about the individual ratings of their competitors,
 they only knew the catchment area averages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The certificate can be used to display the ratings in the shop, similar
 to a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of Tripadvisor but dealers may or may not hang it.
 However, the person who visited all dealers and delivers their personalized
 certificates recommended hanging it, as they might not think about it themselve
s.
 There is also a note on the back of the report which recommends displaying
 the certicate in the shop.
 The delivering person also reminded dealers to read the information on
 the back so that dealers are fully informed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, we expect dealers to be more likely to change their behavior
 ie.
 increase their efforts if they know that they will be scored again.
 They need to expect a second set of scores.
 That is why the person delivering the reports explicitly mentioned to every
 dealer that they will be scored again.
 Furthermore, there is a note on the report that informs dealers that they
 will be scored again in January 2022.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
More collections and disseminations of ratings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second round of agro-input dealer ratings was collected during farmer
 midline data collection in January 2022, after farmers harvested in November/De
cember and the second season of 2021 was over.
 Enumerators revisited farmers for the midline survey and collected the
 second dealer ratings in person.
 The resulting second clearinghouse ratings were disseminated to farmers
 and input dealers between mid-January and mid-February 2022 because farmers
 started buying seed in Feburary/March and planted seed in March/April.
 Farmers also received a second set of SMS in the beginning of March 2022.
 Finally, after the first agricultural season of 2022, the a third round
 of dealer ratings will be collected as part of the end line data collection
 in July/August 2022, because farmers harvest maize in June/July.
 The third rating is a post-treatment outcome variable.
 Knowing that the clearinghouse will remain in place for some time could
 motivate dealers to change their behaviour and increase farmers' trust
 in these ratings.

Specification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the random assignment to treatment and control groups, simply comparing
 outcome variable means of treatment and control farmers and agro-input
 dealers provides unbiased estimates of the effect of the clearinghouse
 intervention on the outcomes of interest.
 Note that impact will be judged by looking at outcomes both at the agor-input
 dealer level as well as at the farmer level.
 To increase power, we condition the estimates on baseline values of the
 outcome variables.
 For this intervention where randomization happened at the catchment area
 level, we look at the impact both at the dealer level and at the farmer
 level.
 We estimate the following specification using ordinary least-squares (OLS)
 to get the average treatment effects (ATE) of the clearinghouse intervention:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Multiple hypothesis testing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we investigate the impact channels of the clearinghouse by considering
 several possible outcomes, it is essential to account for multiple hypothesis
 testing.
 We look at treatment effects on a range of outcome measures and deal with
 multiple hypotheses testing by means of two approaches.
 One approach, followed for example by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "10.2307/2531158"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "kling2004experimental"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, is to aggregate a family of outcomes into groupings to examine whether
 there is an overall impact of the treatment on this family.
 We use a method by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "anderson2008multiple"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and aggregate different outcomes within each domain into single summary
 indices.
 Each index is computed as a weighted mean of the standardized values of
 the outcome variables.
 The weights of this efficient generalized least squares estimator are calculate
d to maximize the amount of information captured in the index by giving
 less weight to outcomes that are highly correlated with each other.
 Combining outcomes in indices is a common strategy against over-rejection
 of the null hypothesis due to multiple inference.
 This approach is useful to see whether a particular treatment has generally
 a positive impact.
 It is for example interesting to group primary outcome variables at the
 agro-input dealer level to see if the clearinghouse treatment has a positive
 impact on dealers.
 However, interpreting these effects can be difficult.
 Furthermore, we remain interested in individual outcomes because they inform
 us about the individual channels of impact.
 For example, it is interesting to see whether the seed handling practices,
 efforts and services of dealers improved at midlinedue to the clearinghouse,
 even though the overall index of dealer primary outcomes might not have
 significantly changed, yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we are interested in the effect of the clearinghouse on individual outcomes,
 an alternative strategy to deal with multiple comparisons is to adjust
 the significance levels according to family-wise error rates.
 Here individual coefficients are considered to be part of a family of n
 hypotheses.
 The family-wise error rate is the probability of at least one type I error
 in this family.
 We can maintain the family-wise error rate at some level α like 0.05 or
 0.10 by adjusting the p-values used to test each individual null hypothesis
 in the family.
 The simplest of these methods is the Bonferroni adjustment, where α/n are
 used as critical values.
 The downside of this method is that it assumes that outcomes are independent,
 and it often too conservative when outcomes are correlated.
 That is why we adjust while accounting for correlation, an approach used
 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "sankoh1997some"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and later by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "aker2012zap"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In this procedure the adjusted p-value depends on the number of outcomes
 being tested, the unadjusted p-value for an outcome, and the mean correlation
 among the other outcomes.
 If outcomes are independent, then the procedure is equal to the Bonferroni
 adjustment.
 If the outcomes are perfectly correlated, the adjusted p-value is equivalent
 to the unadjusted p-value.

Variable construction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For continuous variables, 5 percent trimmed values will be used to reduce
 influence of outliers (2.5 percent trimming at each side of the distribution).
 Inverse hyperbolic sine transforms will be used if skewness exceeds 1.96.
 Trimming will always be done on end results.
 For instance, if the outcome is yield at the plot level, then production
 will first be divided by plot area, after which inverse hyperbolic sine
 is taken and the end result is trimmed.
 Outcomes for which 95 percent of observations have the same value within
 the relevant sample will be omitted from the analysis and will not be included
 in any indicators or hypothesis tests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Missing variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we field our surveys, some respondents will not answer one or more
 questions that measure an outcome.
 We will handle missing variables from survey questions by checking whether
 item non-response is correlated with treatment status, and if it is, construct
 bounds for our treatment estimates that are robust to this.
 To be more precise, we will assess the relationship between missing outcomes
 and treatment assignment using a hypothesis test and report these results.
 If p<.05 for the assessment of the relationship between treatment and missing
 outcomes, we will report an extreme value bounds analysis in which we set
 all of the missing outcomes for treatment to the (block) maximum and all
 missing outcomes for control to the (block) minimum.
 If p≥0.5 for the assessment of the relationship between treatment and missing
 outcomes, we will impute the missing outcomes using the mean of the assignment-
by-block subcategory.

Sample
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section describes the samples to be used in the study.
 Our samples will include input dealers located in trading centers and villages
 (key market sheds) as well as maize farmers that are located in the catchment
 areas of these market sheds.
 The input dealer sample is obtained by including all input dealers of 11
 districts in Busoga.
 These input dealers will be listed during a census that we will do ourselves.
 After the census, dealers will be assigned to a particular catchment area.
 Dealers that are less than 5 km apart are assigned to the same catchment
 area.
 This final list of catchment areas will then be used for the allocation
 of the first treatments according to the design in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 The assignment will be done using a computer algorithm.
 For the first two factors, corresponding to the input-dealer training and
 the information clearinghouse, randomization will happen at the level of
 the catchment area.
 For the third factor that address learning failures of farmers, randomization
 will happen at the level of the village.

We will also randomly sample a fixed number of farmers in a village connected
 to each input dealer.
 This will be done by asking every dealer from which village most his/her
 customers from.
 If this village was already named by another dealer, the village with the
 second most customers will be chosen.
 Enumerators will be sent to these villages and are instructed to randomly
 sample a fixed number of households that meet the inclusion criteria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For some outcomes, details at plot level will be needed (for instance, seed
 spacing and seed rate).
 However, farmers often have more than one plot.
 As outcomes on different plots within the same household are likely to
 be strongly correlated and the interventions are assigned at a higher level,
 it may not be cost effective to survey all plots.
 An unbiased estimate of the outcome at the household level can be obtained
 by randomly selecting one plot.
 To do so, we ask enumerators to first list all plots, with names farmers
 use to refer to these plots (eg.
 home plot, irrigated plot, plot near the sugar cane factory, ...).
 The ODK program then randomly selects one plot for which detailed questions
 are asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will measure the key outcomes of interest before and after the treatments,
 so that we can assess the treatment effects of the three interventions.
 The dealer baseline survey will be conducted in September and October 2020,
 the farmer baseline survey in April 2021, both before the second agricultural
 season of 2021.
 The interventions will be carried out before the second agricultural season
 of 2021.
 To assess their impact, midline data will be collected after the second
 agricultural season of 2021, and end line data will be collected after
 the first agricultural season of 2022.
 The baseline, midline and endline surveys will constitute the key sources
 of data for the study.
 We will collect information on a range of outcome indicators at the level
 of the input dealer.
 The key outcomes of interest can be found in the next section.

\begin_layout Subsection
Variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we register the variables that will be used in the study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Impact will be judged by looking at outcomes both at the input dealer level
 (eg.
 investments in seed storage infrastructure, quantity of seed sold,...) as
 well as at the farmer level (eg.
 likelihood that farmer adopted improved seed, maize yields,...).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regardless of who is targeted by the intervention, we will assess changes
 in outcomes at both the input dealer level and at the level of the farmer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Impact will be judged by looking at outcomes both at the input dealer level
 (eg.

Standard orthogonality tables will be included in the report.
 At each outcome level (farmer and input dealer), we pre-register 10 variables.
 Half of these are characteristics that are less likely to be affected by
 the intervention, while the other 5 are picked from the primary and secondary
 outcomes listed in the next subsection.
 To test balance at the level of the

Primary outcome variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ultimate objective of this study is to see how the interventions increase
 technology adoption and ultimately well-being of the actors involved.
 At the level of the input dealer, we pre-register 7 primary outcomes, aimed
 at measuring increased seed sales both at the extensive (total sales) and
 intensive (sales per customer) margins:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the farmer level, we also pre-register 7 primary outcomes, again evaluating
 the interventions at the extensive and intensive margins.
 We will also look at production and yield, but we do not pre-register these
 as key outcomes as we did not power the experiment to pick up the kind
 of effects that are identified in other studies (see section

\begin_layout Subsection
Secondary outcome variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To identify the steps along the causal chain, we pre-register a range of
 secondary outcomes.
 At the level of the input dealer, we start by investigating changes in
 skills and knowledge, particularly related to seed handling and storage.
 This will be done through 10 multiple choice questions.
 Each multiple choice question will have 3 possible answers from which the
 input dealer can choose (there will also be a "don't know" option).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How long can seed be carried over before losing viability? (q104)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
What is the most important determinant in deciding which seed to buy and
 how much? (q84)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another set of key outcomes is related to seed variety stock and turn over.
 We start with establishing how many improved seed varieties were stocked
 during the second season of 2020 (nr_var, q19, q44).
 We then iterate over the two most important hybrid seeds that are generally
 sold in the area (Longe 10H, Longe 7H).
 We will ask for each seed variety:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How much was carried forward from the previous season (first season 2020)
 into the second season of 2020 (kg) (q21)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How much was bought by you from any provider during the second season of
 2020 (in kg) (q22)

\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
The same questions will be repeated for the two most commonly traded Open
 Pollinated Varieties (Longe 4 and Longe 5).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will also buy one bag of Longe 10H (the most common hybrid).
 On the basis of this, we will:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
test moisture content (see primary outcomes) (q2-reading)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
record production date indicated on package (q3b-date_pack)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Enumerators are also asked to inspect the area where seed is stored.
 Here, we will check:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Temperature (q70)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Is seed stored in a dedicated area, away from other merchandize? (q69)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

 the business is registered with some association) (q81)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
On a scale of 1 to 5, rate this shop in terms of cleanness and professionalism
 (q82)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The interventions may also lead input dealers to voluntarily expose themselves
 to increased scrutiny to signal to farmers that they deliver quality products.
 We thus also ask about membership of business associations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Is this business registered as a seed dealer with UNADA (Uganda National
 Agro-input Dealers Association)? (q114)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Does this business have a trading license issued by local government? (q115)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

 varieties? (q87)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Did you offer discounts to clients that buy large quantities of maize seed
 during the second season of 2020? (q88)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
What is that smallest package of improved seed that you stocked during this
 season (without repackaging)? (q89)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Do you repackage seed yourself when clients want smaller packages than what

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Do you deliver seeds to the premises of farmers? (q98)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we ask input dealers to rate themselves on the following attributes:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Location – are you located close to clients, in a convenient location? (q99)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Price – are you competitively priced? (q100)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Quality of produce, seed in particular – do you sell good products, no fake

\begin_layout Itemize
Stock – is seed available at all time and in the quantities that customers
 want? (q102)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Reputation – are others recommending you? (q103)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the level of the 
\emph on
farmer
\emph default
, we will also look at knowledge.
 However, as the intervention aimed at farmers is less about creating new
 knowledge and more about changing false beliefs, we ask fewer questions,
 and questions that are more open ended and are only asked in the endline
 questionnaire to avoid priming effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Is good seed handling/management less, equally, or more important when using
 quality maize seed like OPV or hybrid seed? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Please indicate what applies for weeding including removing striga when

\begin_layout Itemize
If you want to be a successful farmer, what is the best spacing and number

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additional questions are asked to learn about possible impact pathways:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
What is the most important reason you didn't buy improved maize seed at
 the agro-input shop during the last season? (q25f)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
What is the most important reason you bought improved maize seed at that
 particular agro-input shop during the last season? (q25f_2)

t/adulterated? (q25h)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
enumerator: Ask the farmer to mention as many improved maize varieties that
 they are aware of.
 (q26)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The farmer level questionnaire has a set of questions about all the input
 dealers that are in the catchment area of the farmer.
 As this is part of the information clearinghouse treatment, this module
 is only administered to households in catchment areas that are assigned
 to the clearinghouse treatment.
 We start by asking:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Do you know this input dealer? (q64)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Have you ever bought seed from this input dealer? (q65)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For how long have you been a customer of this input dealer? (q65b)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Do you know anyone who ever bought seed from this input dealer? (q66) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then ask farmers to provide ratings similar to the self-rating of input
 dealers:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
General quality (q68a)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Location – close to clients, in a convenient location? (q68b)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Price – competitive pricing, discounts? (q68c)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Quality of seed – good products, no fake seed? (q68d)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Stock – availability of seeds at all time? (q68e)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Reputation – others are recommending him? (q68f)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then ask farmers to provide ratings of input dealers’ maize seed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Does the seed that the agro input dealer sell is generally considered of
 good quality? (q69a)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Does the seed that this input dealer sells normally leads to yields as advertise
d? (q69b)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Is the seed that this input dealer sells as drought tolerant as advertised?
 (q69c)

\begin_layout Itemize
Is the seed that this input dealer sells as pest/disease tolerant as advertised?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In general, does the seed that this input dealer sells germinate well? (q69f)

\begin_layout Itemize
If there is a problem with the seed of this input dealer, can you carry
 the seed back to this input dealer and get a refund (insurance)? (q70)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Does this input dealer give credit, ie.
 gives you seed (or inputs more in general) that you can pay for later (after

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Does this input dealer offer after-sales service? (q74)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Does this input dealer accept different payment methods? (q75) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Does this input dealer sell small quantities if necessary (1kg)? (q76)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also cycle through maize plots and ask, for a randomly selected plot,
 the following questions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
farmers' seed adoption
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_layout Standard
We will investigate both outcomes at the input dealer level and at the farmer
 level.
 We analyze power at the input dealer level first and consider two outcome
 variables: (i) the quantity of seed sold by the input dealer in the last
 season, and (ii) the reputation of the input dealer.
 The quantity of seed that the input dealer sold is a continuous variable
 (kilogram) with mean 325 and standard deviation 454.
 For the reputation outcome variable, farmers rate the input dealers in
 their catchment areas on a scale from 1 to 5.
 A dealer's reputation is then calculated as the average of those ratings
 and treated as a continuous variable.
 The mean reputation of an input dealer in the sample is 3.68 and the standard
 deviation is 0.61.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also need to assume a treatment effect size for the interventions that
 will be implemented at the catchment area level.
 As we did not immediately find credible studies that evaluated the impact
 of catchment area level interventions on quantity sold nor reputation,
 we decided to define expected treatment effect size in terms of cohen's
 d, settling for a size that is between small and medium, of 0.35 times the
 standard deviation.
 For quantity sold, this means 159 kilogram, while for reputation the minimal
 detectable effect size becomes 0.21.

\begin_layout Standard
Figure

\end_inset

 looks at power levels for different sample sizes (in terms of number of
 catchment areas included in the study) to detect an increase of 159 kilogram
 of improved seed sold by the input dealer at the 5 percent significance
 level.
 If the number of catchment areas is larger than 93, we hit the 80 percent
 power threshold.
 These 93 catchment areas correspond to about 263 input dealers.

 return statistically significant results 80 percent of the time.
 This corresponds to about 318 input dealers.

We consider three variables at the level of the farmer: yield, input use
 and seed quality (based on the rating that farmers give to the seed).
 Maize yield per acre is a continuous variable with a mean of 541 kilogram
 per acre and a standard deviation of 412 kilogram per acre.

The last outcome we consider in our power analysis is the quality of seed
 assessed by farmers.
 The initial quality rating from 1 to 5 is transformed into a binary variable
 with a mean of 0.26 and a standard deviation of 0.44.
 We assume a small effect in terms of Cohen’s d (0.2 times the standard deviation
 or 0.088 percentage points).
 Given this assumption, Figure

 effect sizes similar to the ones

 found.
 Ideally, the total number of farmers that need to be included in the study
 is thus 4,770.
 However, finding impact on yields is hard, as this is an outcome that is
 pretty far down the causal impact chain.
 Yields also show high variability.
 Finally, our project is mainly concerned with increasing seed quality as
 an intermediary to increase yield.
 As such, more direct outcomes such as input use and quality are of primary
 interest.
 Further considering financial constraints and logistics, we decided to
 collect information on 10 farmers per input dealer, leading to a sample
 size of 3,200 households.
 Our expected sample sizes are therefore 318 input dealers and 3,200 households.
 We will collect more data to account for attrition.

Details about factorial design
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec: Details about factorial design"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our factorial design deviates from commonly used factorial designs in that
 the experimental unit differs depending on the factor.
 For the first two factors, corresponding to the information clearinghouse
 and the input-dealer training, randomization happens at the level of the
 catchment area.
 For the third factor that addresses learning failures of farmers, randomization
 happens at the level of the village.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The main motivation to randomize at the village level is to eliminate potential
 spillover effects for the third treatment.
 However, as we will discuss later, we make sure there is correspondence
 between villages and input dealers, which would allow us to also look at
 the impact of the farmer training treatment on outcomes at the input dealer
 level.
 However, at that level, spillovers may affect results.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The resulting layout, with sample sizes indicated in each treatment cell
 is illustrated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Design"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The first two interventions are implemented at the catchment area level.
 A total of 130 catchment areas are included in the study.
 Half of these are randomly allocated to the first treatment: all input
 dealers in 66 catchment areas receive the input dealer training, while
 input dealers in the remaining 64 catchment areas function as the control
 for this treatment.
 This corresponds to 166 and 182 input dealers in these treatment arms.
 Orthogonal to the first factor, the second factor is placed, corresponding
 to the second treatment that is also implemented at the catchment area
 level.
 Also here, in half of the 130 catchment areas an information clearinghouse
 was implemented, and half of the catchment areas function as a control
 for this treatment.
 However, this is done in such a way that balance with respect to the first
 treatment exists in both treatment and control groups for the second treatment.
 This means that the treatment group of the second treatment consists of
 33 catchment areas that received the first treatment and 32 catchment areas
 that function as the control for the first treatment.
 Similarly, for the control catchment areas for the second treatment, 33
 are catchment areas where input dealers received the input dealer training
 and 32 catchment areas where input dealers did not get trained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the third treatment is implemented at the level of the village, it
 is also important to preserve balance in the orthogonal factors.
 In other words, we need to make sure that an equal number of villages that
 are assigned to receive a treatment against learning failures are drawn
 from catchment areas where input dealers received training as from catchment
 areas where the input dealer training did not take place.
 Similarly, orthogonality should also be maintained for the second treatment.
 Therefore, in each of the four treatment cells formed by interacting the
 first two treatments, 175 villages were randomly assigned to the third
 treatment while another 173 villages were assigned to the control.
